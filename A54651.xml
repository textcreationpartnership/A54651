            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>Chriſtian Reader,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I had no thoughts of writing out the enſuing diſcourſe, until a very good friend of mine requeſted me, that when I had opportunity I would do ſo much for him, which I was not very forward unto, not reſolved againſt: But upon further con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, I did intend according to my ſmall ability, and as I had time, to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie his deſire. But before I had begun it, ſeveral others alſo were as deſirous as the former, both to have it written out, and alſo that it ſhould be made publick. The former is now done, but whether the latter deſire will be anſwered or no, I yet know not.</p>
            <p>That which made me the more wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to grant what was deſired by my<pb facs="tcp:48995:3"/>Friend, and Friends was, That I might in ſome meaſure diſcover the abuſe of the Doctrine of Election by many of the Leaders of the People, whereby many Blind ones being led by the Blind, fall into the ditch of Errour: And many others alſo are indangered alſo ſo to do. For as it was ſaid in former times by the Lord concerning ſome Teachers; ſo ſurely it may be ſaid of too many in ours: <hi>Thy Interpreters have tranſgreſſed againſt me,</hi> Iſa. 43. 27. What the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures ſpeak concerning Election agrees ſweetly with the word of the beginning of Chriſt, to wit, That He is indeed the Saviour of the World; And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore nothing at all oppoſeth them who believe it. But Men, in their Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Gloſſes, pervert thoſe things which are more hard to be underſtood: And then alſo they wreſt the other Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, which are more eaſie to their own and others, deſtruction; that they may make them agree with their perverſions of the more hard, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 16. So it is<pb facs="tcp:48995:3"/>in this particular inſtance. They firſt deviſe and imbrace a new Doctrine of Election, which the Scripture knoweth not, to wit, An abſolute Election of ſome mens perſons in a perſonal conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration before the World had a being: And then they deny, or confeſs not, that Jeſus Chriſt by the Grace of God taſted Death for every Man; or, that the Grace of God brings Salvation to all men, that they may be ſaved. That ſo there may be ſome agreement in their inſtructions which cauſe to err from the words of knowledge. But thoſe who firſt begin with, and learn the word of the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of Chriſt, which is the foundation of other Doctrines, receive light there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from by degrees into other Doctrines which are built thereon: And in follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Chriſt therein, who is the light of the World, they ſhall not abide in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, but the light ſhall be vouchſafed, and ſhine more and more unto them until the perfect day.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:48995:4"/>If any ſhould fault me for not ſpeaking to other Scriptures which ſome think fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour their device of perſonal Election, as
<hi>Acts</hi> 13. 48. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 28-30. &amp;c. Let them know, I have not medled with them, both becauſe the word Election is not expreſſed therein: And alſo, and eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially becauſe theſe, and other Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of like nature are ſpoken unto alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy more fully and profitably then I can do by my Brethren and Helpers in the Lord; as by Mr.
<hi>Thomas Moor</hi> Sen. in his Book entituled <hi>An explicite declaration of the Teſtimony of Chriſt,</hi> from page 354. to 372. and page
451-457. And in his Treatiſe of Election. And by Mr. <hi>John Horn</hi> in his <hi>Eſsays,</hi> page 24. 26, &amp;c. And therefore to them I refer them, becauſe alſo I have been much more large then I at firſt intended.</p>
            <p>And let not them who believe the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of God concerning Chriſt, <hi>viz.</hi> That He is the Son of God, and Saviour of the World, deceive themſelves, in<pb facs="tcp:48995:4"/>thinking that my only, or principal end and aim in what I have written is, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect the errours of them who are enemies thereto: for though I have endeavoured ſo to do in ſome things for their good who do ſo err: And to preſerve others from ſuch evil and erronious Doctrines, if they have an heart and opportunity to read this: Yet I principally intended this diſcourſe to diſcover how many vain believers of the Goſpel of Chriſt there are, who though they are called, yet are not choſen: And for admonition to them, and inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to all who have the form of ſound words, that we might all of us, not only in word profeſs to believe Chriſts Goſpel. But ſo from the heart obey it, that we may be and abide free from ſin, and become continually ſervants unto Righteouſneſs, that we may have our fruit unto Holineſs, and the end Eternal Life.</p>
            <p>Conſider what is ſaid herein, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare it with the word of God, and Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of Jeſus: And what agreeth there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with<pb facs="tcp:48995:5"/>embrace it, and yield up thereto: And if in any thing I have diſſented there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from, let it be rejected. <hi>Try all things, hold faſt that which is good.</hi>

And when theſe firſt bidden Gueſts, the <hi>Jews,</hi> refuſed and made light of it, he commands again. <hi>Go ye into the High-ways</hi> (unto the Gentiles) <hi>and as many as ye ſhall find, bid to the Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age,</hi> ver. 8, 9, 10. And ſo it is to the Marriage, and Marriage-feaſt, there-with and thereby prepared to which the many are Called, Bidden and Invited.</p>
            <p>Now the Marriage to which they are Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, ſignifieth not only, as ſome ſay, the Feaſt prepared; though that may be, and is included alſo: But firſtly and principally the Marriage it ſelf, which the King of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, the moſt High God, the Poſſeſſor of Heaven and Earth (who is indeed a great King, <hi>Mal.</hi> 1. 14.) made for His Son, His only Begotten Son; In which the Divine and Humane Nature were Married and Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in a cloſe, and Perſonal Union, in the Perſon of the Word, the Son of God; which was the Root and Cauſe of that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion prepared for us: And to which Men are Called, to the end they might come to, and be Eſpouſed unto Jeſus Chriſt. This, I conceive, is firſt meant and intended by
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:48995:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>the Marriage here ſpoken of, that in which <hi>the Word was made Fleſh. For aſmuch as the Children were partakers of Fleſh and Blood, He alſo Himſelf likewiſe took part of the ſame:</hi> That in our Nature He might be further Abaſed for us, that He might take out of the way all that was contrary to us, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain into Himſelf all <hi>the fulneſs of Grace and Truth,</hi> John 1. 1, 3, 14. Heb. 2. 14. This is the firſt Branch in the Myſterie of Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, God was manifeſt in the Fleſh, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 16. And being made of a Woman, He was under the Law, as Mankind was fallen under it, yet without Sin; And had the Sins and Treſpaſſes of the World imputed to, and laid upon Him: God made Him to be Sin for us, who knew no ſin, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 4. with <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 19. 2
<hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 19, 21. And in and by this Marriage He was fitted and prepared to be Wounded for our Tranſgreſſions, and Bruiſed for our Iniquities, and to Taſte Death for us, even that firſt Death, which was the Wages of our firſt Sin and Sinful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: As here it is ſaid, <hi>My Oxen and Fat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings are killed,</hi> Mat. 22. 4. Chriſt our Paſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over hath been Killed and Sacrificed for us, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 7. And ſo, That whereto Men are Called firſt of all, it is to the Beholding, View, and Belief of, the Abaſement and Death of the only Begotten Son of God in
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:48995:8" rendition="simple:additions"/>the Nature of Man, which is indeed the procuring Cauſe of all the Glory conferred upon it in His Perſon, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.
3. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 1. <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 6. 9. <hi>John</hi> 3. 35. with
<hi>Chap.</hi> 10. 17. <hi>Rev.</hi> 5. 12. And becauſe all that is Treaſured up in Chriſt is the Purchaſe and Procurement of His Croſs and Sufferings; therefore the Goſpel is called, <hi>The Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Croſs, and of Chriſt Crucified,</hi> 1 Cor. 1. 17, 18. 22, 24. and Chap. 2.
1, 2. Gal. 3. 1. and Chap. 6. 14.</p>
            <p>And together herewith alſo they are Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led unto the Marriage-feaſt, or Dinner, which is prepared by means of the Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of Chriſt, in the Virtue whereof He is raiſed again, in which all things are ready: Which in a like Parable to this, <hi>Luke</hi> 14. 16, 17. is called,
<hi>A great Supper:</hi> Great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, for in it all things are ready. And it is called, <hi>a Supper;</hi> becauſe once in the end (or Evening) of the World Chriſt appeared to put away Sin by the Sacrifice of Himſelf,
<hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 26. This Purpoſe and Grade was given in Chriſt before the Ancient, or Agie Times: But in theſe laſt Times, all Things are now actually prepared, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 9, 10. ſo as in Him there is a Juſtification from the Guilt of our firſt Sin and Sinfulneſs,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 22, 23. and 5. 18. the aboliſhing of our firſt Death, 2
<hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 10. A Victory obtained<pb n="7" facs="tcp:48995:8"/>by Him over all our Enemies, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 14. <hi>John</hi> 12. 31. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 98. 1. And in Him there is Redemption through His Blood, even the Forgiveneſs of our following Sins, <hi>Acts</hi> 13. 38, 39. And He hath brought in ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Righteouſneſs, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 21. And re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the Spirit without meaſure, <hi>John</hi> 3. 34. <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 33. In Him are hid all the Treaſures of Wiſdom and Knowledg, <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 3. He is full of Grace and Truth, <hi>John</hi> 1. 14, 16. God hath given us Eternal Life, and this Life is in His Son, 1 <hi>John</hi> 5. 10, 11. Yea, in Him it hath pleaſed the Father that all Fulneſs ſhould dwell, <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 18, 19. and 2.
9, 10. He is Glorified in our Nature with the Father's own ſelf, with the Glory He had with Him before the World was, <hi>John</hi> 17. 4, 5. All Things that the Father hath are His, <hi>John</hi> 16. 15. The Father ſo loveth the Son becauſe He laid down His Life for us that He might take it up again, that He hath given all Things into His Hand; All Spiritual Bleſſings in Heavenly things; all things that pertain to Life and Godlineſs: And all Power both in Heaven and in Earth, <hi>John</hi> 10. 17. with <hi>Chap.</hi> 3. 35.
<hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1. 3. <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 18. By means of His being Sacrificed for us, there is a Feaſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for us, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 7, 8. A Feaſt of fat Things, of Wines on the Lees, of fat things<pb n="8" facs="tcp:48995:9"/>full of Marrow, of Wines on the Lees well Refined, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 25. 6.
<hi>Prov.</hi> 9. 1, 3. And to this Marriage-feaſt alſo are Men Called, and Bidden, that they might partake hereof, and their Souls be ſatisfied here with as with Marrow and Fatneſs, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55. 1, 2, 3.</p>
            <p>And ſo that whereto men are Called, is to Jeſus Chriſt and Him Cruciſied, and that excellent and compleat Preparation provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in Him: They are called into the Grace of Chriſt Jeſus, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. 6. The Spirit of Chriſt in the Prophets did teſtifie before hand of the Sufferings of Chriſt, and the Glory that ſhould follow. And theſe things are now Reported to us in the Goſpel with the Holy Ghoſt ſent down from Heaven, 1
<hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 11, 12. with <hi>Luke</hi> 24. 25, 27.</p>
            <p>To Chriſt, God the Father was, and is, Calling and Directing men: To the Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, He ſaid, <hi>This is the Reſt wherewith ye may cauſe the weary to reſt, and this is the Refreſhing,</hi> Iſa. 28. 12.
16. <hi>Behold, ſaith he, my Servant whom I uphold,</hi> &amp;c. Iſa. 42.
1. 6, 7. He hears Witneſs of Him; and Chriſt is ſo the Sum of his Teaching, that every one that hath Heard and hath Learned of the Father cometh unto Him, <hi>John</hi> 5. 31, 37. and 6. 45.</p>
            <p>Unto Himſelf Jeſus Chriſt alſo calleth men: He ſaith,
<hi>Look unto me all the ends of<pb n="9" facs="tcp:48995:9"/>the Earth, and be ye ſaved: For I am a Juſt God and a Saviour, and there is none beſide me,</hi> Iſa.
45. 21, 23. with Phil. 2. 8, 9, 10. And He ſaith, <hi>Behold me, behold me, unto a Nation that was not called by His Name,</hi> Iſa. 65. 1. Thou ſhalt, ſaith the Father, Call a Nation which Thou kneweſt not, to wit, unto Thy ſelf; for ſo much is ſignified in what follows: <hi>And Nations that knew not Thee, ſhall run unto Thee,</hi> &amp;c. Iſa. 55. 5. <hi>All things,</hi> ſaith our Saviour, <hi>are delivered unto me of my Father,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Come unto me—I will give you reſt,</hi> Iſa. 49. 1. 6. Mat. 11. 27, 28. John 7. 37, 38.—</p>
            <p>It is alſo the Work of the Holy Spirit, to Lift up the Son of Man, as <hi>Moſes</hi> lifted up the Serpent in the Wilderneſs, that Men might look unto, and believe in Him. To bear Witneſs of Jeſus Chriſt: To take of His things, His Abaſement, Death, Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection and Glory, and to ſhew unto us: And therefore alſo He is called, <hi>the Spirit of Chriſt,</hi> John 3. 5, 6, 14. and 15. 26. and 16. 14, 15. <hi>Acts</hi> 5.
30, 32. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 9. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 11.</p>
            <p>Yea, the one God, Father, Word, and Holy Spirit, beareth His Record of Jeſus Chriſt, and this is the Record, that God hath given us Eternal Life, and this Life is in His Son, 1 <hi>John</hi> 5. 7, 10, 11. Yea, to<pb n="10" facs="tcp:48995:10"/>Him all the holy Ones call us; the Spirit and the Bride ſay, <hi>Come;</hi> to wit, unto Chriſt: And let him that heareth ſay,
<hi>Come,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Rev.</hi> 22. 16, 17.</p>
            <p>And hereby we may ſee the deſperate fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and madneſs of Men, who forſake, or come not unto the Lord, the Fountain of Living Waters, but hew them out Ciſterns broken Ciſterns, that can hold no Water,
<hi>Jer.</hi> 2. 12, 13.</p>
            <p>And it might Ingage and Provoke us all to obey this heavenly Call, and run unto Chriſt, becauſe of the Lord his God, and for the Holy One of
<hi>Iſrael,</hi> who hath Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified Him in Himſelf; and diſplayed the Preciouſneſs of His Blood, and His Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency and Comelineſs by means thereof ſo our eſcape, before us in the Goſpel: And is Calling and Inviting us unto Him, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55. 5. with <hi>John</hi> 13. 31, 32. Oh! let us not turn a deaf Ear to this Call, but let us incline our Ears and come unto Him, let us hear that our Souls may live, <hi>&amp;c. Iſa.</hi> 55. 2,
3. Conſidering alſo that which follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth. Namely,</p>
            <p>The Account and Ground upon which Men are Called unto this Marriage, and Marriage-feaſt, is, becauſe it was intended and prepared for them: <hi>If the Trumpet give an uncertain ſound, who ſhall prepare him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf<pb n="11" facs="tcp:48995:10"/>to the Battel?</hi> 1 Cor. 14. 8. But ſo doth not this Trumpet in the glorious Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel of God: for as it gives a <hi>joyful ſound,</hi> Pſal. 89. 15. ſo alſo a certain one. <hi>Gods Mouth hath therein ſpoken Truth, and Wickedneſs is an Abomination to His Lips: All the Words of His Mouth are in Righteouſneſs, there is nothing froward, or wreathed in them,</hi> Prov. 8. 6, 8. This is a faithful Saying, and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of all Acceptation, it is both true and Good, that Chriſt Jeſus came into the World to ſave Sinners: Sinners indefinitely, and without excluſion of any,
1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 15. This His Marriage of our Nature is, and was by an Heavenly Meſſenger proclaimed to be <hi>Glad tidings of great joy to all people,</hi> Luke 2. 10, 11, 14. And Chriſt had the Treſpaſſes of the World imputed to Him, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 19, 21. And by the Grace of God He taſted Death for every man, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 9. And is Riſen again for the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> Juſtification: So that as verily as all have ſinned in the firſt Publick Man, and are come ſhort of the Glory of God: So alſo they are Juſtified freely by God's Grace through that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption that is in Chriſt Jeſus, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 22, 24. and 5.
18. And in Him there is a Feaſt prepared for all People, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 25.
6. Forgiveneſs of Sins for all Nations, <hi>Luke</hi> 24. 47. <hi>Acts</hi>
26. 17, 18. Righteouſneſs for <pb n="12" facs="tcp:48995:11"/>all, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 22.
<hi>Iſa.</hi> 61. 11. Eternal Life for all Mankind, while it is called to day, 1 <hi>John</hi> 5. 10, 11, 12. A Salvation prepared before the Face of all People: <hi>Neither is there Salvation in any other,</hi> Luke 2. 30, 31. Acts
4. 12. And on this Ground it is that men are Invited to come to this Marriage, and Marriage-feaſt becauſe it was made, and made ready for them, even for
<hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and ſo conſequently for all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
<hi>Mat.</hi> 22. 2. 8, 9, 10. <hi>Luke</hi> 14. 16. 24. On this account His Servants have been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked and excited to Intreat and Beſeech men generally to receive the Grace of God to purpoſe: The Love of Chriſt did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain them, to perſwade men to come unto Jeſus Chriſt, becauſe they thus judged, that if one died for all, then were all dead, and that He died for all,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> And after they had given an account of the Miniſtry of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation which they had received, to wit, that God was in Chriſt (when one died for all, and roſe again) Reconciling the World unto Himſelf, not imputing their Treſpaſſes unto them, but unto Chriſt, they ſay: Now therefore we are Ambaſſadours for Chriſt, as though God did beſeech you by us, we pray you in Chriſts ſtead be ye reconciled un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God, 2
<hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 11, 14, 15, 19, 20, 21. and 6. 1. <hi>John</hi> 3. 14, 16. and
4. 42. Hence<pb n="13" facs="tcp:48995:11"/>the Lord maketh Proclamation and Invita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to every Thirſter, both to ſuch as thirſt out of neceſſity, and to ſuch alſo as thirſt out of delight, having taſted the Graciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Lord; and ſaith, <hi>Ho, every one that thirſteth, come ye to the Waters, and he that hath no money,</hi> &amp;c. And to move them hereto, He ſaith, <hi>Behold, I have given Him for a Witneſs:</hi> For a Witneſs of His Love and Faithfulneſs: <hi>He hath ſo loved the World that He hath given His only begotten Son, to be the Saviour of it, that all men through Him might believe,</hi> John 3. 16, 17. and 1. 7. 1 John 4. 14. And hence exhorts men, <hi>To ſeek the Lord while He may be found, and call upon Him while He is near.</hi> Yea, <hi>The Wicked to forſake his ways, and the man of Iniquity his thoughts, and to return unto Him, and He will have Mercy,</hi> &amp;c. Iſa. 55. 1. 4, 6, 7. Here is a good account and ſure ground given in the Goſpel, both for the Servants to Call, ſo as they ſhall not run at uncertainty, nor fight as thoſe that beat the Air: But may both Preach to any man, or every man, as they have opportunity, and Pray for them, Without wrath, though they be their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies; and without doubting, whether God bears any good Will to them or no: For they may certainly know and conclude, God will have all men to be ſaved, and come<pb n="14" facs="tcp:48995:12"/>to the knowledg of the Truth: Becauſe Chriſt gave Himſelf a Ranſome and Price of Redemption to God for all, a Teſtimony in due time. And for thoſe who are Called, who from hence may be Incouraged upon principles of Certainty and Truth to come unto Him, in whom dwelleth all the Ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Godhead bodily, and in whom is all Compleatneſs prepared and treaſured up for us. <hi>And whoſoever believeth in Him ſhall never be aſhamed nor confounded,</hi> Luke 6. 27,
36. 1 Cor. 9. 26. 1 Tim. 2. 4, 6, 8. And ſo much for the firſt Inquiry.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> By whom are the many Called?</p>
            <p>By the Servants Inſtrumentally and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſterially, and eſpecially by the Apoſtles in theſe laſt days. For, as we have ſaid, our Saviour in this Parable ſpeaketh Propheti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally of the Goſpels being Preached unto <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> after He had finiſhed the Work the Father gave Him to do upon the Earth: And after His Death, Reſurrection, Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſion, Receipt of, and ſending forth the Holy Spirit in His Name, in and by which His Apoſtles were fitted and furniſhed to Preach the Goſpel according to the Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Myſtery: For until then the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants had not Commiſſion and Furniture to Preach among the
<hi>Gentiles</hi> the unſearchable Riches of Chriſt. And though when Chriſt<pb n="15" facs="tcp:48995:12"/>was riſen from the Dead, He gave Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to His Apoſtles, to go into all the World, and Preach the Goſpel to every Creature of all the Nations; yet they were by Him commanded to tarry at
<hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> until they were Indued with Power from on High, that they might be fitted and inabled to put in Execution that Authority and Commiſſion they had received, <hi>Mark</hi> 16. 15. <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 18,
19. <hi>Luke</hi> 24. 47, 49. And then they were to be Chriſts Witneſſes unto all men of what they had ſeen and heard. And yet though by the Servants here are meant, the Apoſtles principally, yet not only: For the Bride in general ſaith, <hi>Come:</hi> And he that heareth is commanded to ſay,
<hi>Come, Rev.</hi> 22. 17. And ſo the many are Called by the Servants of the King indefinitly, though principal Reſpect is had to the Apoſtles. So much is plainly ſignified to us in this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that the many Called are called to this Marriage, and Marriage-feaſt by the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants: So it is ſaid as with reſpect to the <hi>Jews: The King ſent forth his Servants to call them that were bidden to the Wedding,</hi> Mat. 22. 3. Again, <hi>He ſent forth other Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,</hi> Ver. 4. And when the firſt invited Gueſts refuſed, and diſpitefully uſed them; he ſaith to his Servants, <hi>The Wedding is ready, but they which were bidden were not worthy:<pb n="16" facs="tcp:48995:13"/>Go ye therefore into the High-ways,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> thoſe Servants went out into the High-ways, and gathered together all, as many as they found,</hi> Ver. 8, 9, 10. And indeed it is the Work of the Faithful Servants of the great King, not to Commend, or Preach them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, but Jeſus Chriſt the Lord, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 5. And not to Diſciple men unto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, but to call and Eſpouſe them to one Husband, that they might be preſented as a chaſte Virgin unto Chriſt,
<hi>Acts</hi> 20. 28, 30. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 1, 2, 3. Their great Buſineſs is, to bear Witneſs of Chriſt, of His Sufferings, and of what He hath thereby done and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained into Himſelf, and is become, and is: And of what He is now doing, both from Heaven in the Name of the Father to us: And in Heaven with the Father for us: And what He will do hereafter, <hi>John</hi> 15.
27. <hi>Acts</hi> 5. 30, 32. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. 1. <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 7, 8. And not to proclaim their own goodneſs, as the moſt men do, <hi>Prov.</hi> 20.
6. that men might admire them, or have their Faith ſtanding in their Wiſdom, Goodneſs, or Holineſs, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 1, 5. <hi>Acts</hi> 3.
12. But to Confeſs, Praiſe, and Call men unto Him, in whom dwelleth all the Fulneſs; that in coming unto, and believing in Him, they might of His Fulneſs receive, and Grace for Grace.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:48995:13"/>But though they are called by the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants inſtrumentally; yet not by them only: The King ſends them not alone on this Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rand of His; but He accompanies them by the Light, Influence and Power of His Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Spirit, in their plain and faithful Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration: So much in former Times was ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified to us: As, in that Scripture like to this, and whereto, it may ſeem, our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our referreth in this Parable, <hi>Prov.</hi>
9. 1, 3. <hi>Wiſdom hath Builded her Houſe, She hath hewen out her ſeven Pillars; She hath killed her killing, She hath mingled her Wine, She hath alſo furniſhed her Table: She hath ſent forth her Maidens,</hi> [She]
<hi>crieth upon the higheſt places of the City,</hi> &amp;c. Though She ſent them forth to call others into the Houſe, yet Her Preſence goes along with them: And not only they Cry and Call; but alſo She crieth.
<hi>Doth not Wiſdom cry, and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding put forth her Voice? She ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in the top of High places,—She crieth at the Gates of the City,—Unto you, O men, I Call, and my Voice is to the Sons of Man.</hi> She ſends forth her Spirit in and with Her Servants, that they might be ſucceſsful In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments in Her hand, <hi>Prov.</hi> 8. 1, 4, 5. with

And that He was faithful who promiſed, another Evangeliſt informs us, ſaying, they went forth Preaching the Goſpel every where, the Lord working with them,
<hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 18, 20. with <hi>Mark</hi> 16. 15. 20. Hence they are ſaid to be Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers together with Him, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 1.

And this Conſideration, that the many are Called by the Servants, the Lord working with them, may be of uſefulneſs unto us.</p>
            <p n="1">1. To ſhew unto us the evil and falſeneſs of mens ſayings, in which they divide and ſeparate the Word of Chriſt in the faithful Miniſtration of it, from the Spirit, and ſay: It is true, many men are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> Called with an outward Call, but they are not Called with an inward and effectual Call: The Servants ſpeak to their outward Ears, but God by His Spirit ſpeaketh not unto the Hearts of them. The contrary to what they ſay plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appeareth to be true, in what hath been ſaid from the Scriptures of Truth. God is certainly preſent in and with His own Word, that it might be received by men. As the Apoſtle ſignifieth: <hi>I have planted, Apollo watered, but God gave the Increaſe.</hi> So then, neither is he that Planteth any thing, neither he that Watereth: But God that gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth the increaſe. For we are Labourers
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:48995:15"/>together with God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Apoſtle ſaith not, as many do in their Gloſſes corruptly, and injuriouſly to the Text, and Souls of Men: <hi>Paul may plant, and Apolla water, but God muſt give the Increaſe.</hi> In which ſaying they Imply, that the former may be without the latter: But the Apoſtle evidently aſſures us, not that God Muſt only, but that He doth give the Increaſe, whether men receive it or not. And therefore when He ſpeaks in the time paſt of their Labouring, He ſpeaks in the time paſt of Gods Co-operation. I have planted, but God gave,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> And when in the time preſent of the former, he ſo alſo ſpeaketh of the latter. <hi>Paul plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, Apollo watereth, but God giveth the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe.</hi> It is true indeed, we are to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh between the Word, and Spirit, but not to divide between them, as if when ever God ſends His Servants to Preach the Goſpel, He doth not vouchſafe His Spirit to go along with them, which is not true, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 5, 7, 9. Nor is it ſafe or good for any to conclude from the event, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe men receive not, therefore God gives not: For God may give and yet men not receive. God may turn men, and yet men may not be eventually turned: God may draw men unto Chriſt, and yet they may <pb n="21" facs="tcp:48995:15"/>not come, but break his Bands aſunder, and caſt away his cords from them: God may Purge, and yet men through their ſtubborn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs may not be purged, his goodneſs may lead them to Repentance, who yet are not led thereby to it, but may forſake Him when He leads them by the way, <hi>Neh.</hi> 9. 20, 26. <hi>Acts</hi> 26. 18.
<hi>Haſ.</hi> 11. 4, 5. <hi>Jer.</hi> 5. 5. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 24. 13.
<hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 4, 5. Chriſt, the Good and Faithful Sower, ſoweth the good Seed, the Word of the Kingdom, in the Hearts of the worſt ſort of Hearers, to the end they might Believe and be Saved: And it would effect this in them, did they not ſuffer the Devil to ſteal away that which was ſown in their hearts, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13, 19. with <hi>Luke</hi> 8. 12. And certainly, therefore alſo the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel is called, The Miniſtration of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, becauſe it doth ſo infallibly accompany it in the faithful Preaching thereof, that they that Preach the one, Miniſter the other, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi>
3. 6, 8. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 2, 5. And hence alſo the Words of Chriſt are ſaid to be Spirit and Life; and the Spirit is ſaid to be the Word of God,
<hi>John</hi> 6. 63. with <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6. 17.</p>
            <p n="2">2. This Conſideration alſo may Incourage his Servants who bring good Tidings, to get them up into the high Mountains, to Lift up their Voices with ſtrength, to Lift them up; and not be afraid, or aſhamed of<pb n="22" facs="tcp:48995:16"/>their Meſſage, becauſe His Spirit remaineth with them, <hi>Hag.</hi> 2. 5. This is contained in Gods Covenant with Chriſt, and them that turn from Tranſgreſſion in <hi>Jacob;</hi> that his Spirit that is upon Chriſt, and his words which he hath put into his Mouth, ſhall not depart out of his Mouth, nor out of the Mouth of his Seed (the Apoſtles and firſt Truſters in Chriſt) nor out of the Mouth of his Seeds ſeed (thoſe that believe on Chriſt through the Apoſtles Word, <hi>John</hi>
17. 20, 22.) ſaith Jehovah, <hi>from henceforth, and for ever;</hi> His Spirit and His Words go together inſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parably, in the Mouth of His Servants: So that, while they ſpeak His Words to the outward Ears of men, His Spirit ſpeaks to the Hearts of men: And thence He exhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth His Servants:
<hi>Ariſe, ſhine,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 59. 20, 21. and 60. 1. Alas, otherwiſe His Servants might be diſcouraged and aſhamed, and even ſay as He did: <hi>O my Lord, ſend I pray thee by the hand of him whom thou wilt ſend,</hi> Exod. 4. 13. For they have no ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency of themſelves to think any thing as of themſelves; though they be in pain, and labour to bring forth, yet they will bring forth nothing but the Wind; they can of themſelves work no deliverance in the Earth, neither will the Inhabitants of the Earth
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:48995:16"/>fall before them, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 5. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 26.
17. 18. But now, this may Incourage them to Lift up the Hands that hang down, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm their feeble Knees, that the Great King will be with their Mouth in ſpeaking His Word; ſo as, where the Word of this King is, there alſo ſhall be Power going along with it, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 8. 4. with
<hi>Luke</hi> 4. 18, 32. Hence the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>I am not aſhamed of the Goſpel of Chriſt, for it is the Power of God,</hi> &amp;c. Rom. 1. 16. Go ye forth therefore, ye Servants of the Lord, in this your might, holding forth the Word of Life; hath not He ſent you, whoſe Preſence ſhall go along with you? He will not leave you nor for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake you, <hi>Judg.</hi> 6.

            <p n="3">3. It may alſo Admoniſh His Servants to declare the Teſtimony of God without Excellency of Speech, or of Wiſdom: See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing He hath promiſed to be always with them; and faithful is He that hath promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, who alſo will do it. Let them make uſe of quaint Language, inticing Words, and Excellency of mans Wiſdom (if they pleaſe) who think they may, or know not but they do go alone: But he that hath Gods Word, let him ſpeak Gods Word faithfully: <hi>What is their Chaff to this Wheat? Is not His Word like as a Fire? And like an Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer<pb n="24" facs="tcp:48995:17"/>that breaks the Rock in pieces?</hi> Jer. 23. 28, 29. It argues a ſecret fear and jealouſie in men, as if the Goſpel of Chriſt were a Weak, Forceleſs, Spiritleſs Doctrine, and needed ſome what of mans to make it pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful; when they deliver it in the Words, or with the Arguments, which mans wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom teacheth: And in thus doing they are ſo far from making it more Effectual, or Saving to men, that they render it Inforci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and Inefficacious, becauſe they thus corrupt the Word of God, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 14. 17. <hi>Chriſt ſent me,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle—<hi>to Preach the Goſpel, not with wiſdom of Words, leſt the Croſs of Chriſt ſhould be made of none effect. For the Preaching of the Croſs</hi> (even this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Preaching it, without wiſdom of Words, the fooliſhneſs of Preaching) <hi>is to them that periſh Fooliſhneſs, but unto us that are ſaved it is the Power of God,</hi> 1 Cor. 1. 17, 18, 21. <hi>The weapons of their Warfare, who War not after the fleſh;</hi> after the Wiſdom or Guidance thereof, <hi>are not Carnal, but Mighty through God, to the pulling down ſtrong Holds, caſting down Imaginations,</hi> &amp;c. 2 Cor. 10. 3, 4, 5. It is good therefore for Chriſts Servants in Calling men to the Marriage, and Marriage-feaſt, to beware of Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy and vain Deceit. Yea, and to chuſe<pb n="25" facs="tcp:48995:17"/>rather to ſpeak five Words with their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, that they may Teach others alſo, then Ten Thouſand words in an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known Tongue; for in ſo doing, they do as to the Generality of men ſpeak into the Air: Yea, are unprofitable to all, and not underſtood by the moſt of men, 1
<hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 19. And to that end, its needful both to deny deſires of vain Glory: Aſwel as alſo to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that the plain and fooliſh Preaching of the Goſpel is the Way God hath pitcht up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for Saving men: And how weak or fooliſh ſoever this Way appears to the Wiſe ones, yet, the FooliſhneſS of God is Wiſer then men, and the Weakneſs of God is ſtronger then men, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 21, 24, 25. <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 8, 9, 10. Oh then! how doth it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hove His Servants, ſeeing they have ſuch hope, to uſe great plainneſs of Speech! And not as <hi>Moſes,</hi> who put a Vail over his Face, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 6, 12, 13. <hi>To renounce the hidden things of Diſhoneſty, not walking in Craftineſs, nor handling the Word of God deceitfully, but by manifeſtation of the Truth commending themſelves to every mans Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in the ſight of God,</hi> 2 Cor. 4.

            <p n="4">4. It may exhort us, to give diligent heed to their Words and Calls, and to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem them highly for their Works ſake, who
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:48995:18"/>ſpeak to us the Word of God, becauſe their Maſter alſo is preſent with them, and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtant to them; it might therefore Ingage us when His Servants come amongſt us, to ſay in our hearts, however, as the Centurian did to <hi>Peter, We are all here preſent before God, to hear all things that are commanded thee of God,</hi> Acts 10. 33, 34. The Apoſtle ſpeaks this to the praiſe of the Churches of <hi>Galatia,</hi> that when he firſt Preached the Goſpel amongſt them, they received him (notwithſtanding his Temptation in the fleſh) as an Angel of God, even as Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 13, 14. Oh! <hi>How Beautiful are, and ſhould be, the feet of them that Preach the Goſpel of Peace, and bring glad Tidings of good things?</hi> Rom. 10. 14, 15. Did we in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed conſider, that they call us unto the Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip of Jeſus Chriſt our Lord, and into the Grace of Him, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 9. <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. 6. And that the great King of Heaven and Earth ſpeaks by them, and with them; and doth, as it were, by them beſeech us to come and Eat of Wiſdoms Bread, and to Drink of the Wine ſhe hath mingled: <hi>To forſake the fooliſh and Live,</hi> &amp;c. It would certainly be powerful with us, to Ingage us to receive their Word, and obey their Call, not as the word or call of men, but as it is
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:48995:18"/>in truth, of God, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2. 13. And to account them worthy of double Honour who Labour in the Word and Doctrine, for their Maſters ſake, even becauſe they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to, and are Labourers with Chriſt. And though not to Idolize them, or think of them more highly then we ought to think; yet to account them as Miniſters of Chriſt, and Stewards of the Myſteries of God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 1, 6. And to know, that when, in and with Preaching the Goſpel of Chriſt, they Call upon and Invite us to come unto the Feaſt, God alſo Calleth us, and enableth us to what He Calleth us un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to. And as our Saviour ſaith to His Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples: <hi>Verily, verily, I ſay unto you, he that receiveth whomſoever I ſend, receiveth Me: And he that receiveth Me, receiveth Him that ſent Me,</hi> John 13. 20. Whereas, were the moſt of men Called with an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Call only, they might either receive, or reject the Caller, and neither receive nor reject Jeſus Chriſt, or Him that ſent Him.</p>
            <p n="5">5. This Conſideration ſhews unto us, their cauſleſs Iniquity, and inexcuſable fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, who, when they are thus Called to Chriſt by ſuch a Powerful and Effectual Call, yet regard not, but turn a deaf Ear thereto: Of ſuch our Saviour ſaith, <hi>Ye<pb n="28" facs="tcp:48995:19"/>will not come unto Me that ye might have life,</hi> John 5. 32, 36, 39, 40. This was the provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Iniquity of Gods People in former Times, whereby God was greatly Incenſed againſt them. <hi>They—refuſed to hearken, and pulled away the ſhoulder, and ſtopped their Eaers that they ſhould not hear: Yea, they made their hearts as an Adamant ſtone, leſt they ſhould hear the Law, and the Words which the Lord of Hoſts had ſent in His Spirit by the former Prophets: Therefore came a great Wrath from the Lord of Hoſts: Therefore it is come to paſs, that as he cried and they would not hear; ſo they cried, and I would not hear, ſaith the Lord of Hoſts,</hi> Zech. 7.
11, 13, 14. Indeed thoſe Perſons who ſay, the greateſt part of the Called ones are only called with an outward and ineffectual Call, put a Plea into their Mouths, and fill them with Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, to excuſe their not coming: They may ſay, they had no power of themſelves, and God gave them none, or not that which was ſufficient: Theſe teach men to lay the blame upon God, and to father the brats of their diſobedience on Him: But alas, it will appear in concluſion, that ſuch charge God fooliſhly: And that, though the Spirit that dwelleth in us luſteth to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vic; yet He giveth more Grace, that Grace<pb n="29" facs="tcp:48995:19"/>which brings Salvation to all men, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able us to come at His Calls: And at laſt He will be Juſtified in His Sayings, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come when He is Judged, <hi>James</hi> 4. 5, 6. with <hi>Tit.</hi> 2. 11. This is mens iniquity, not that they cannot come of themſelves, but that they will not, when God is enabling them hereto: <hi>This is the Condemnation, that Light is come into the World, and men loved Darkneſs rather then Light,</hi> &amp;c. John 3. 19. 20. And certainly, God may Expoſtulate with us, as He did with <hi>Iſrael</hi> of Old, and ſay: <hi>Oh thou who art Named the Houſe of Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob, is the Spirit of the Lord ſtraightned?</hi> Though thou haſt no power, nor ſufficiency of thy ſelf, as of thy ſelf to come to Chriſt, yet is the Spirit of the Lord ſhortned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards thee? Are theſe (thy diſobedience, and refuſals to come) His doings? Are they His doings, becauſe He prevents thee not with power and capacity to what He Calls thee to? Indeed they might be ſaid to be His doings, did He Call thee to the Feaſt, and Threaten thee with deſtruction, and yet not aſſord thee any power or ability to come: As He might be ſaid to Kill who did not what was proper and powerful to ſave the Life. when He had an opportunity: But it is not ſo here: <hi>For as in His Hand<pb n="30" facs="tcp:48995:20"/>is Power and Might, ſo alſo in His Hand it is—to give ſtrength unto all, He is Gracious, and gives liberally unto all men without upbraid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> Mic. 2. 7. with Mark 3. 4. 1 Chron. 29. 12. Jam. 1. 5. And therefore it will be found to be ſuch an Iniquity in men, as for which they will have no cloak (however artificial their ſpiritual Taylors are) that they will not come to Chriſt when thus Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led: As our Saviour ſignifieth, when He ſpeaketh concerning the <hi>Jews,</hi> ſaying: <hi>If</hi> [I] <hi>had not come:</hi> Though my Servants had come never ſo oft, and Called and Invited never ſo frequently and urgently; <hi>Yet if</hi> [I] <hi>had not come and ſpoken unto them they had not had ſin, but now they have no cloak for their Sin,</hi> John 15. 22.
<hi>Becauſe I have Called,</hi> ſaith Wiſdom, <hi>and ye refuſed: I have ſtretched out my hand</hi> (my Power and Spirit in and with my Call, to inable you to come) <hi>and no man regarded: But ye have ſet at nought all my Counſel, and would none of my Reproof: I alſo will laugh at your Calamity, and mock when your fear cometh,</hi> &amp;c. Prov. 1. 20, 24, 31.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Why ſaith He [<hi>Many</hi>] are Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and not [<hi>All?</hi>]</p>
            <p n="1">1. Not becauſe all men, who are capable, are not Called in due time by ſuch means<pb n="31" facs="tcp:48995:20"/>as the Great King in His infinite Wiſdom is pleaſed to make uſe of: For the Mighty God, even Jehovah hath ſpoken, [<hi>And Called the Earth, from the rifing of the Sun unto the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down thereof,</hi>] Pſal. 50. 1. Wiſdom crieth without (without the City, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Pale of the profeſſed Church, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, where are Dogs,

<hi>Rev.</hi> 22. 15. with <hi>Mat.</hi> 15. 26, 27.) <hi>ſhe ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereth her Voice in the ſtreets.—How long ye ſimple ones will ye love ſimplicity, and the ſcorners delight in their ſcorning, and fools hate knowledge? To theſe ſhe calleth, and ſtretcheth forth her hand,</hi> Prov. 1. 20, 23, 24. Doth not Wiſdom cry, and Underſtanding put forth her Voice? (Can any one truely deny this?) ſhe ſtandeth upon the Top of High places, by the Way, in the places of the Paths. She crieth at the Gates at the entry of the City, at the coming in of the Doors (that is, ſhe crieth and lifteth up her Voice every where, without, and within the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, abroad and at home, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But to whom doth ſhe put forth her Voice? Surely, to men indefinitely; for ſo it followeth) <hi>unto you [O men, I call, and my Voice is to the Sons of man.]</hi> And not of <hi>Iſrael</hi> only: <hi>O ye ſimple underſtand wiſdom.—Hear, for I<pb n="32" facs="tcp:48995:21"/>will ſpeak of excellent things,</hi> &amp;c. Prov. 8. 1, 4, 6, 10. and 9. 1, 4, 5. Chriſt was and is the true Light, which Lighteth every man that cometh into the World: And He is therefore a Light unto them, that He might be for Salvation unto the ends of the Earth, <hi>John</hi> 1. 9. and 8. 12, with
<hi>Iſa.</hi> 49. 6. and <hi>Acts</hi> 13. 47. And the Goſpel is Preached in every Creature, or in all the Creation un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Heaven, <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 23. And thoſe who have with the heart received the wholſome Words of our Lord Jeſus, and the Doctrine which is according to Godlineſs, know and believe, that God would have all men to be ſaved, and come to the knowledg of the Truth: And that, becauſe Chriſt gave Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a Ranſome for all, a Teſtimony in due time, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 4. 6. And though mens voices will be heard but a little way, yet lo, he ſendeth forth His Voice, and that a Mighty Voice, and ſaith; <hi>Look unto me all the ends of the Earth, and be ye ſaved: For I am God and there is none elſe,</hi> Iſa. 45. 22. Pſal.
19. 1. 6. with Rom. 1. 19, 21. Yea, and the word [<hi>Many</hi>] doth alſo ſometimes ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie All. <hi>As</hi> [many] <hi>of them that are in the duſt of the Earth ſhall awake: Some to everlaſting Life, and ſome to ſhame and ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting contempt:</hi> Certainly, all that are in
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:48995:21"/>the Graves ſhall hear the Voice of the Son of man, and ſhall come forth, compare <hi>Dan</hi> 12. 2. with <hi>John</hi> 5. 27, 29. 1
<hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 20, 21. So again: Through the offence of one [<hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi>] are dead: And as by one man's diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience [<hi>many</hi>] were made Sinners: When as it is evident, that by one man Sin entred into the World, and Death by Sin, and ſo Death paſſed upon [<hi>all</hi>] men, for that
[<hi>all</hi>] have ſinned, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 15, 19. with <hi>Ver.</hi> 12.

31. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 32. 10.</p>
            <p>But though what we have ſpoken under this Head be verily true; both that in due time, God calleth all men, as is ſaid, to the end they might come to the knowledg of the Truth and be ſaved: And that [<hi>many</hi>] may ſignifie [<hi>all.</hi>] Yet notwithſtanding I judge.</p>
            <p n="2">2. By [<hi>many</hi>] in this place we are inſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on, all men are not intended nor meant.—Not only,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Becauſe all Infants are not called, and commanded to come into the Houſe, and they are a very great part of the World: But nothing is required of them in their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capacity: Hence, when the Lord ſaith to
<hi>Iſrael: Thou ſhalt love the Lord thy God, and<pb n="34" facs="tcp:48995:22" rendition="simple:additions"/>keep his Charge, and his Statutes, and his Judgments, and his Commandments alway:</hi> He addeth, <hi>And know you this day, for I ſpeak not [with your Children,</hi> &amp;c.] Deut. 11. 1, 2. God is no hard or auſtere Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, to Reap where He hath not Sown, nor Gather where He hath not Strowen; though wicked Servants ſo ſay. As where much is given, much will be expected; and where little, little: So by the ſame rule of Equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, where nothing is given, of ſuch no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing will be required. Indeed Infants are a part of the Nations that are to be Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled; and, as a means to that end, to be Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized by the Servants, in, or unto the Name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt, being brought unto them for that purpoſe. As in former Times the Male-Infants of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were to be Circumciſed: And the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel is to be Preached as to Include them alſo as the Subjects of the great and funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Truths thereof, to wit, <hi>That Chriſt hath Died and is Riſen again for them,</hi> &amp;c. Mat. 28. 18, 19. with Mark. 16. 15. But until they come to the Uſe and Exerciſe of Underſtanding, or ſome Capacity be vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafed to them, there are no Commandments given unto them by the Lord Jeſus. But, I ſay, not only in this Conſideration it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:48995:22"/>that by [<hi>many</hi>] all men are not here intended. But alſo,</p>
            <p n="2">2. Becauſe in this Parable our Saviour ſpeaketh of mens being Called by the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, as is before ſhewn: And ſo of their being Called and Invited to the Feaſt by the clear and diſtinct Declaration of God's Grace in Chriſt by the Goſpel: And ſo all men, who are come to years of Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, are not Called, <hi>viz.</hi> by the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants in the plain Preaching of the Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, and Marriage-feaſt therewith and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by prepared. The Commiſſion is given to the Servants firſt to Call the
<hi>Jews;</hi> and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they made light of the Feaſt and Invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, the King ſaid to the Servants, go ye into the High-ways, and [<hi>as many as ye ſhall find</hi>] bid to the Marriage. So thoſe Servants went out into the High-ways, and gathered together all [<hi>as many as they found,</hi>] Mat. 22.
8, 10. Theſe are the [<hi>many</hi>] here ſpoken of; as many as the Servants found, and Preached the Goſpel unto, according to the Revelation of the Myſterie. And theſe may be called [<hi>many</hi>] to Intimate to us, that all Nations and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in the World have not this Favour vouchſafed to them; though yet a multitude have. And called [<hi>many</hi>] to ſignifie
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:48995:23"/>That this advantage is now more largely vouchſafed then in former Times: Then He ſhewed His Word unto <hi>Jacob,</hi> that one People and Nation, His Statutes and His Judgments unto <hi>Iſrael;</hi> He dealt not ſo with any other Nation: And as for His Judgments they have not known them,
<hi>Pſal.</hi> 147, 19, 20. <hi>Deut.</hi> 4. 5, 8. And unto them He ſent all His Servants the Prophets, riſing early and ſending them, becauſe He had compaſſion upon them, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 36. 15, 16. <hi>Jer.</hi> 7.
25. And herein they were pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledged above, and had greater advantage then other Nations: According to that, What advantage then hath the <hi>Jew?</hi> Or what profit is there of Circumciſion? Much every way, chiefly, becauſe that unto them were committed the Oracles of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 1, 2.
<hi>Acts</hi> 3. 25. But they were the few<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt of all People: And however, but one Nation at firſt, and ſo very few in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon of all Nations. But now after the Oxen and Fatlings were actually ſlain, and the Feaſt prepared, the Servants Commiſſion was inlarged, and many Nations were Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by their Miniſtration, and Profeſſedly believed the Goſpel, and yielded fained Obedience to Chriſt. Yea, and at this time, many Nations, though not all, have<pb n="37" facs="tcp:48995:23"/>Scriptures of Truth amongſt them, and therein the Goſpel as Preached according to the Revelation of the Myſtery by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles: And His Servants continued and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved amongſt them; ſutable to thoſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies, and ſuch like: <hi>Thou ſhalt Call a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thou knoweſt not, and Nations that knew not thee ſhall run unto thee,</hi> Iſa. 55. 5. <hi>He ſhall ſprinkle many Nations,</hi> Iſa.
52. 15. <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Nations ſhall be joyned to the Lord in that day,</hi> Zech.
2. 11. And of [<hi>theſe many</hi>] we have to ſpeak in what followeth, and ſo would be underſtood. Though yet we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire that theſe three Cautions may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered and minded in the whole Treatiſe. To wit,</p>
            <p n="1">
               <hi>Caution,</hi> 1. When we ſay [<hi>many</hi>] only, and not all, are intended in this Parable: We mean not, nor believe, all the reſt are not Called by any means: For though All are not Called by the diſtinct Preaching of Chriſt in the Mouth and Miniſtry of His be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving Servants; yet God leaves not Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf without Witneſs to others: But that which may be known of God is manifeſt in them, for [<hi>God</hi>] hath ſhewed it unto them; for the Inviſible things of Him, from the Creation of the World are clearly ſeen, being underſtood by the things that<pb n="38" facs="tcp:48995:24"/>are made; even His eternal Power and God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 19, 20. Hence the Apoſtle when he had been intimating that men cannot believe except they hear, propounds a Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and gives Anſwer thereto. <hi>But, I ſay, have they not heard?</hi> Namely, the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel: <hi>Yes, verily</hi> (even ſo heard that they might believe, for ſo much appeareth by the ſcope of the place) <hi>their ſound went into all the Earth, and their Words unto the ends of the World:</hi> In which the Apoſtle referreth to <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19. 1,
6. And ſignifieth, that the Goſpel is Preached in every Creature,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 14, 18. with <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 23. And ſo, though all are not called by the Servants in the clear and plain Preaching of the Goſpel: Yet all, that are capable, are in due time called by the Lord of the Servants, who is Lord of all, (as is before ſhewn.) And who is not willing that any ſhould periſh, but that all ſhould come to repentance.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Nor do we ſuppoſe, or believe, that none of them, who are not of the Many here ſpoken of, may hereafter partake of Eternal Life, though they have not the clear and diſtinct Revelation and Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of Chriſt and the Goſpel vouchſafed to them. But (however ſome zealous ones, though not according to Knowledg,<pb n="39" facs="tcp:48995:24" rendition="simple:additions"/>neither have, nor think they want this Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,) yet we deſire to be ſo charitable, and believing of the Scriptures as to conclude; God is no reſpecter of Perſons, but in every Nation he that feareth God, and worketh Righteouſneſs is accepted of Him: As was <hi>Cornelius,</hi> before the Goſpel was plainly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared to him, and many others amongſt <hi>Gentiles, Acts</hi> 10. 2, 34. and 13. 26. and 16. 14. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Yea, in this Parable is ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied to us, that when the Servants went out into the High-ways, they found ſome good ones amongſt the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> that were ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore called by them, <hi>Mat.</hi> 22. 10. And had they died before the Goſpel had been plainly Preached to them (as doubtleſs ſome ſuch did) they ſhould have injoyed Eternal Life in due ſeaſon. The Judg of all the Earth will do right, and not deſtroy the Good, ſuch as He reputes ſuch, with the bad,
<hi>Gen.</hi> 18. 24, 25. And though all ſhall be Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed according to the Rule of the Goſpel, yet it ſhall be according to the means vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafed. And if the Uncircumciſion, who have not the Law and Doctrine of God, keep the Righteouſneſs of the Law (as the Appoſtle ſuppoſeth he may do) if he believe that God is, and is a rewarder of them that diligently ſeek Him: Shall not His uncircum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion<pb n="40" facs="tcp:48995:25"/>be counted for Circumciſiou? Shall not he come acceptably to God, and be graciouſly rewarded with Eternal Life? Yes ſurely, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 6. Certainly many Thouſands, and Ten Thouſands, ſhall be eternally Saved, who were never Called by the Servants with the plain Preaching of the Goſpel; and who never had any diſtinct knowledg of Jeſus Chriſt, while they were in Mortal Bodies: As, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants dying in their Incapacity; and many
<hi>Jews</hi> before the firſt Coming of Chriſt: And many fearers of God amongſt the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> both before and ſince Chriſts Appearing to put away Sin by the Sacrifice of Himſelf, <hi>Mat.</hi> 2. 16, 18. with
<hi>Jer.</hi> 31. 15, 17. <hi>Mat.</hi> 19. 14. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 11 5. 9, 10,
11. And yet there is no Salvation in any other but Chriſt; and through Him, and through His Name, Power, and Authority, and upon the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of His Sufferings and Sacrifice they ſhall be ſaved, though no clear or diſtinct knowledg of Him was vouchſafed to them: And therefore the want of it ſhall not be Imputed to, or Charged upon them to their Condemnation. And this Charity we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to have, becauſe we thus judge, that one Died for all, and Roſe again, <hi>viz.</hi> That Jeſus Chriſt by the Grace of God taſted
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:48995:25"/>Death for every man, and is Riſen again from the Dead for their Juſtification: And hereby, all that have ſinned in the firſt pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick man, and come ſhort of the Glory of God, are Juſtified freely by God's Grace through that Redemption in Chriſt Jeſus, in an anſwerable ſence as they were Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the firſt man <hi>Adam,</hi> 2
<hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 14, 15. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 9. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 23, 24. and 5.
18. So as no man ſhall periſh in that firſt Death for ever, which was the Wages of the Diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of that one man: Nor in the Eternal Judgment ſhall there be any occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for the uſe of that Proverb, <hi>The Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers have eaten ſower Grapes, and the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drens teeth are ſet on edge,</hi> 1 Cor. 15. 20, 21. Jer. 31. 29, 30. Ezek. 18. 2, 4. And in the Croſs of Chriſt, and Virtue thereof, we ſo ſee the admirable Love of God to every ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Creature of Mankind, while it is called to day; aſwell as alſo in plain Intimations and Inſtructions given us in the Teſtimony of the Scriptures: That we cannot but judge, that His Requirings and Expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons will be no other then according to His Diſtributions and Diſpenſations; that is, where much is given, of them He will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire the more; and where little, He will require but according thereto: And where
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:48995:26"/>He hath not ſown He will not reap, nor gather where He hath not ſtrowen. And therefore all Infants, who die in their Infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and were never guilty of that Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Sin of the World, of loving Darkneſs rather than Light, after Light is vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafed, ſhall in the general Reſurrection have Eternal Life through Chriſt's Name. And all others who have not had any diſtinct knowledg of Chriſt, and yet by the Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Mercy of God through the Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour have been led to Repentance, and have feared God, and been Workers of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, according to the means vouchſafed; and continued ſuch to Death, ſhall alſo through Chriſt have the reward of Everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Life, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 4, 6. 2
<hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 9, 15. <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 4, 7, 12, 16. <hi>Luke</hi> 12. 48.
<hi>Mat.</hi> 25. 24, 26. <hi>Rev.</hi> 20. 12, 15. But how can they have ſuch Charity, or deſire to have it, who deny, or believe not, the Great and Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental things of the Goſpel, as ſpoken and delivered to us in the Words which the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt teacherh! <hi>Do men gather Grapes of Thorns, or Figs of Thiſtles?</hi> Mat. 7. 15, 16. Thoſe Builders can never Build well who diſ-alow and reject the Foundation.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Nor do we believe that by the [<hi>many</hi>] called are meant, all ſuch as are Called by<pb n="43" facs="tcp:48995:26"/>realous Teachers, and ſuch as name them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves the Miniſters of Chriſt; or however not ſuch in this conſideration, as Called by them; for there are many ſuch who in their evil Doctrines rather Call men from Chriſt then to Him. How many are there that diſciple men to Antichriſt, inſtead of invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them to our Lord Jeſus; and ſteal a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the Word of God from the People in the Records of them? And how mauy o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers are there, though not ſo groſly evil, yet as dangerous and deſtructive to the ſouls of men; who though they would have the Scriptures continued amongſt men in ſuch Languages as are underſtood by them; yet they tell them the meaning of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is the Scripture, and that is ſuch as lieth not in the plain import of the Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions; however not in many of the funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Sayings of the Goſpel: And the Scripture, ſome call, a dead Letter; other ſome call it, the Letter: And their Gloſſes and Interpretations are the Spiritual mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Thus they call the World which God ſo loved as to give His Son to be, and of which He is, the Saviour, the World of Elect, the [<hi>all and every man</hi>] for whom Chriſt! Dred, ſome of all ſorts, or every Godly man, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> thus indeavouring to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert<pb n="44" facs="tcp:48995:27"/>the Goſpel of Chriſt. And yet ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing very zealous in ſeeking the good of men, which is indeed ſomewhat ſtrange, conſidering that they believe Chriſt Died for the feweſt of men only, and for whom they know not: As one of them lately ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt himſelf in his Prayer, ſuch an one as it was, as I was inſtantly informed by ſome Credible perſons that heard him.
[<hi>Lord,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>if there be any one Soul in this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation</hi> (which was a great one) <hi>for whom Chriſt hath Died, let me not loſe my Labour.</hi>] And conſidering alſo that they believe that there is a preciſe and certain number of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons determined to Salvation: And theſe ſhall Infallibly be Saved, though they held their Tongues; and all the reſt inevitably periſh. I ſay, theſe things conſidered, it is ſomewhat ſtrange they ſhould be ſo ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearingly zealous in ſeeking the good of men Indefinitely: It may be fcared, this Zeal pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds not from the Love of Chriſt: For the Love of Chriſt conſtraineth us, ſaith the Apoſtle, becauſe we thus judg, that if one Died for all, then were all dead, and that He died for all, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Which they believe not: But that herein they are like them who did ſhut up the Kingdom of Heaven againſt men, neither entring in themſelves,<pb n="45" facs="tcp:48995:27"/>nor ſuffering them that were entring to enter: And yet for a pretence they made long Prayers (for their Hearts went after their Covetouſneſs) and they did compaſs Sea and Land to make a Proſelite, <hi>Mat.</hi> 23. 13, 14, 15. Truly, concerning ſuch who Preach and Plead for ſuch Doctrines as theſe,
<hi>viz.</hi> That Chriſt Died not for all men, but for the feweſt only. That God hath Decreed a ſet and determinate number of Perſons in a Perſonal conſideration to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve and be ſaved: And theſe all ſhall In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſruſtrably believe and be ſaved, and theſe only; and all the reſt muſt unavoidably periſh. That ſuch as are once in Chriſt cannot poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly fall finally from the Grace of God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It may be ſaid: <hi>Hearken not to the Words of theſe Prophets—they make you vain, they ſpeak a Viſion of their own Heart, and not out of the Mouth of the Lord,</hi> Jer. 23. 16. 21. 2 Pet. 2. 1. For how much ſoever theſe thus Call, and how much ſoever others Liſten thereto; and how Reformed and Zealous ſoever they appearingly be come hereby; they are not, in this Conſideration, of the Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led here ſpoken of, much leſs of the Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen.</p>
            <p>But the [<hi>many</hi>] that are Called, are ſuch as are Called to Chriſt (as is before<pb n="46" facs="tcp:48995:28"/>ſaid) by Chriſt's Servants, in proclaiming Chriſt's Goſpel unto them, in the Words which the Holy Ghoſt hath Taught. As the Great King directs His Servants to Call to the Wedding; ſo He puts into their Mouths what they ſhould ſay, which is Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marily the form of ſound Words. He ſent forth other Servants, ſaying, <hi>Tell them which are bidden, behold, I have prepared my Din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, my Oxen and Fatlings are killed, and all things are ready, come unto the Marriage,</hi> Mat. 22. 4,

               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> To what end are the many Called?</p>
            <p>Certainly, They are therefore Called and Invited to the Wedding and Dinner, that they might obey the Call, and come and Eat of Wiſdom's Bread, and Drink of the Wine which She hath mingled: <hi>Forſake the Fooliſh and Live, and go in the Way of Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding,</hi> Prov. 9. 1, 3,

His end herein was not, nor is, to leave men without excuſe, or to aggravate their Condemnation; though this will be the Iſſue and Effect of mens ſtubborn, and ſtill continued in refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal:<pb n="47" facs="tcp:48995:28"/>But we may ſee the End of the Lord to be ſuch as declareth, that He is very piti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, or, very well Bowelled, and of tender Meroies to the Souls of men, as <hi>James</hi> 5.
11. <hi>For as God ſent not His Son into the World to condemn the World, but that the World through Him might be ſaved,</hi> John 3. 17. 1 John 4. 14.
<hi>And the Son of Man came not to deſtroy mens ſouls or Judge the World, but to ſave them, to ſave the World,</hi> Luke 9. 55, 56. John 12. 47. So, as the Father ſent Him, and accordingly He came into the World; He ſent and preſerveth His Servants in the World, that they might Call men unto Himſelf, to the end they might come and be Saved, <hi>John</hi> 17. 18, 22. He ſendeth them to open the Eyes of the Blind, and to turn them from Darkneſs to Light, and from the power of Satan to God, that they may receive Forgiveneſs of Sin, and Inheritance among them that are Sanctified by Faith that is in Chriſt, <hi>Acts</hi> 26. 17, 18. We have this ſame Parable, or a like to it, men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in <hi>Luke</hi> 14. 16, 17. And there it followeth after our Saviour's giving Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions about an earthly Feaſt; and was ſpoken, as it ſeems, at a Feaſt, <hi>Ver.</hi> 1. 14. Now to what end doth an honeſt man pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide a great Dinner or Supper, and Invite
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:48995:29"/>Perſons to it by his Servants? Is it not that they might come and partake hereof? Doth he Intreat and Beſeech men to come? And when they will not be perſwaded and prevailed with, is he very angry with them for ſuch refuſal? And yet had no Cordial deſire, or intention they ſhould come. What ſhould we call this amongſt men? Not Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty, or Sincerity, but Diſſimulation. And ſhall we entertain ſuch evil evil and wicked thoughts of God as to think; That though He hath prepared a Dinner at ſuch a dear Coſt, and Invites men thereto, and is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly and eternally Angry with them who will not come, yet He never meant or intended they ſhould come? Or ſhall men call this an holy Diſſimulation, when they cannot but ſee it is a Diſſimulation? Is not this the way to make them Diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blers alſo who thus think and ſpeak of God, how Holy ſoever they appear, or would be thought to be, as they were whoſe Leaven was Hypocricy?
<hi>Mat.</hi> 23. Oh! far be it from us to think thus wickedly of God! He is Perfect, Upright, and without Diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulation in all His Mercy and Kindneſs: Hence whereas in one Evangeliſt, our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our ſaith: <hi>Be ye merciful as your Father is:</hi> In another, it is: <hi>Be ye Perfect as your

<hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 48. and 6. 1. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> To ſignifie to us, that in all Gods Kindneſs, and Kind and Gracious In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitations, He is perfectly Merciful, <hi>And hath pleaſure in Uprightneſs,</hi> 1 Chron. 29. 17. And becauſe He knows what evil thoughts and jealouſies concerning Him proceed na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally out of our Hearts; and to the end they ſhould not lodg within us: Therefore He aſſures us of His Uprightneſs and Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity in His Calls and Invitations: <hi>Unto you, O men, I call, and my Voice is to the Sons of man: O ye ſimple underſtand Wiſdom, and yee fools be ye of an underſtanding Heart; hear, for I will ſpeak of Excellent things, and the opening of my Lips ſhall be right things: For my Mouth ſhall ſpeak Truth, and Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is an abomination to my Lips. All the Words of my Mouth are in Righteouſneſs (and not in Hypocriſie, for theſe two are oppoſed the one to the other,</hi> Mat. 23. 28.)—<hi>Receive my Inſtruction,</hi> &amp;c. Prov. 8. 4, 7, 10. He ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth burning Lips and a wicked Heart, and ſaith, <hi>Their wickedneſs ſhall be ſhewed before the whole Congregation,</hi> Prov. 26. 23, 26. And warns us to beware of ſuch whoſe Lips drop as the Hony-comb, and their Mouths<pb n="50" facs="tcp:48995:30" rendition="simple:additions"/>are ſmoother then Oyl: <hi>But their end is bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter as Wormwood, ſharp as a two-edged Sword,</hi> Prov. 5. 3, 4.

[Called] <hi>thee from the Chief men there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and ſaid unto thee, thou art my Servant, I have</hi> [Choſen] <hi>thee,</hi> &amp;c. Iſa. 41. 9. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed in 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2. 13, 14. Choſen, is there placed in words before Called: But it evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently appeareth to any Judicious and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prejudiced Reader, that in that place, Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led goeth before Choſen in Order of Nature; for thus the Words are: <hi>God hath Choſen you from the beginning unto Salvation, through, or in, the Sanctification of the Spirit, and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of the Truth.</hi> Whereunto (namely, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to<pb n="53" facs="tcp:48995:31"/>which Sanctification of the Spirit, and Belief of the Truth, in which they were Choſen) He Called you by our Goſpel, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It is very clear that in order of Work, though not of Word, Called went before Choſen: For if they were Choſen in the Belief of the Truth; And men cannot believe on Him of whom they have not heard, nor hear without a Preacher of the Goſpel, then it neceſſarily followeth, men muſt be Called by the Goſpel before they can Believe, and ſo before they are Choſen, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 14, 15. And ſo in the Order of Nature, this agrees with the other Scriptures forementioned.</p>
            <p>Now, though the order of expreſſions ſimply, when but at ſometime onely ſo pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, proveth nothing: yet when the ſame order is alwayes, or generally ſo obſerved by the Holy Ghoſt, it is worthy our conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and not lightly to be paſſed over by us. <hi>Gen</hi> 48.
5. 20. Indeed ofttime in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, for ſome good reaſon, thoſe perſons or things are mentioned laſt in words, which otherwiſe ſhould have been before ſpoken of; becauſe the Holy Ghoſt would begin with them again; or ſpeak more fully of them. So [<hi>Believing</hi>] is put after
[<hi>Confeſſing</hi>] in one <hi>Verſe;</hi> but then it is begun with, and firſt mentioned in the next, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 9, 10.<pb n="54" facs="tcp:48995:32"/>So [<hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi>] is placed after the ſeven Spirits, becauſe He is largely Deſcribed and Treated of in what followeth,
<hi>Rev.</hi> 1. 5, 6. And thus we might ſhew in many other places. But neither of theſe can be affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed concerning the order of Words in the Scripture we are ſpeaking to, for it is the Concluſion of our Saviour's Speech in this Parable; nor of the reſt mentioned.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That by Election is not meant ſuch a Purpoſe or Decree, as is before ſpoken of, nor by the Elect here, the ſubjects of ſuch a Decree, may appear further in this; that thoſe who were afterward Elected, or made of the Choſen Generation, were not of it in former times. To this purpoſe the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeaketh: <hi>Ye are a Choſen, or Elect Generation, a Royal Prieſthood,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Which in time paſt were not a People, but are now the People of God, which had not obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Mercy, but have now obtained Mercy,</hi> 1 Pet. 2. 9, 10. Where it plainly appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that <hi>Ver.</hi> 10. ſheweth, They were not formerly ſuch Perſons as he affirms them now to be in <hi>Ver.</hi> 9. Now ye are Elected or Choſen, but in times paſt ye were not ſo, even in the time paſt when they walked in Laſciviouſneſs, Luſts, exceſs of Wine, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellings, Banquettings, and abominable<pb n="55" facs="tcp:48995:32" rendition="simple:additions"/>Idolatries,
<hi>Chap.</hi> 4. 3. To the ſame pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe alſo the Apoſtle
<hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaketh, as with reſpect to <hi>Jews</hi> and
<hi>Gentiles,</hi> Rom. 9. 24, 25, 26. <hi>I will call them my People</hi> (which not only were not called, but) <hi>were not my People: And her Beloved</hi> (or Elect, compare <hi>Iſa.</hi> 42. 1. with <hi>Mat.</hi> 12.
18.) <hi>which was not Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved, or Elect.</hi> And indeed men are Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen in Chriſt, as afterwards we may ſhew: But there was a time when <hi>Paul</hi> (who was after Converted, a Choſen Veſſel) was not in Chriſt; and then he was not an Elect, or Choſen one, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1. 4. with
<hi>Rom.</hi> 16. 7. So the Preacher alſo ſignifieth, that ſuch as not at preſent Elected may be ſo, while it is called to day, in that he ſaith:
<hi>Remember thy Creator in the days of thy youth,</hi> or, <hi>of thy Elections,</hi> (as others do alſo rightly read it) that is, either, 1. In the days of thy Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, whilſt thou mayeſt chuſe Life, chuſe the beſt part, which ſhall not be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from thee, <hi>Deut.</hi> 30. 19.
<hi>Luke</hi> 10. 42. Or, 2. In the days of thine Elections, when thou mayeſt be Choſen, though at preſent thou art not; there are days for that, in which ſuch as are not Elected may be ſo, while it is the day of his Grace and Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 12. 1. Yea in our Types, the very preciſe time is intimately ſet down,<pb n="56" facs="tcp:48995:33"/>when God choſe Iſrael,
<hi>Ezek.</hi> 20. 5. <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord God [in the day when I choſe</hi> Iſrael.] And ſometimes [<hi>Chuſing</hi>] is men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in the preſent time. As, <hi>Bleſſed is the man whom thou [Chuſeſt] and cauſeſt to approach unto thee,</hi> Pſal. 6 5. 4.</p>
            <p n="3">3. It is further evident, That God's E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect are not ſuch manner of Perſons as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny would perſwade us they are: For they, who plead for ſuch an irreſpective, or abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute purpoſe, affirm: That the Elect were Choſen before the World in a perſonal Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, and ſo remain ſuch when Born into the World; and while they abide alſo in their Ignorance and Unbelief, and Diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to God: They ſuppoſe, though it be not manifeſted, that prophane Perſons, Drunkards, Whoremongers, Unbelievers, yea, Perſecutors of Chriſt and His People, may be of the Elect. But however they are ſome mens Elect, they are not the Elect of God:
<hi>For the Elect of God are ſuch as are Holy and Beloved,</hi> Col. 3. 12.
<hi>The Elect Generation is an holy Nation,</hi> 1 Pet. 2. 9. <hi>God's Elect are ſuch as to whom there is no Condemnation;</hi> as the Apoſtle intimateth when he ſaith: <hi>Who ſhall lay any thing to the charge of God's Elect? It is God that Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth, who ſhall Condemn?</hi> It plainly appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,<pb n="57" facs="tcp:48995:33"/>that God's Elect are ſuch as He con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demneth not, but in the preſent time Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth. Now He condemneth all Unbelie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, and condemneth no Unfeigned belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers: Therefore it plainly appeareth, that the Believers only are the Subjects of God's Election, and not any Unbelievers, while abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in their Unbelief. To this purpoſe God's prime Elect one ſaith: <hi>He that believeth is not condemned: Who ſhall lay any thing to His charge? It is God that Juſtifieth. But he that believeth not is condemned already</hi> (and ſo at preſent none of God's Elect)
<hi>becauſe he hath not believed,</hi> &amp;c. compare Rom. 8. 33, 34. with John 3. 16, 18, 19. <hi>He that believeth on the Son hath everlaſting Life: But he that believeth not the Son ſhall not ſee Life, but the Wrath of God abideth on him,</hi> John 3. 36. Yea, who are God's Elect whom He Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demneth not, but Juſtifieth; the Apoſtle gives us to underſtand, namely, ſuch as are in Chriſt Jeſus, who walk not after the Fleſh, but after the Spirit: Not ſuch as are in Chriſt ſimply, but ſuch as together there with walk in Chriſt as to their demeaner, compare <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 33, 34. with <hi>Ver.</hi> 1. Now then, time was when <hi>Paul</hi> was in Unbelief, 1
<hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 13. And then he was condemned, and ſo not of the Elect, or Choſen Generation.<pb n="58" facs="tcp:48995:34"/>And again, God's Elect are ſuch as cry un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Him night and day, <hi>Luke</hi> 18. 7.</p>
            <p n="4">4. God's Elect can hardly be deceived, as our Saviour ſignifieth when He ſaith: <hi>There ſhall ariſe falſe Chriſts, and falſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, and ſhall ſhew great ſigns and wonders; inſomuch that if poſſible they ſhall deceive</hi> [the very Elect,] <hi>Mat.</hi>
24. 24. <hi>Mark</hi> 13. 22. By the way; Our Saviour here doth not ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie, that none of the very Elect may poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly be deceived: This Phraſe [<hi>if poſſible</hi>] denotes not the utter and abſolute Impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of ſuch a thing, no more then it doth elſewhere. As where the Evangeliſc ſaith of <hi>Paul: He haſted</hi> [if poſſible]
<hi>for him to be at</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>the day of Pentecoſt,</hi> Acts 20.
16. Certainly, no wiſe man would haſten to do that which he knew was altogether impoſſible to be done. So <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 18. with
<hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 14. But our Saviour ſignifieth, Both that the falſe Teachers would uſe all ways and means poſſible to ſeduce them, ſo that thoſe that were not ſeduced by them, we may ſafely conclude, they could not poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly deceive. Aſwel as alſo the Phraſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noteth, that it is a very difficult thing for ſuch to be ſeduced and deceived, though it be not altogether and abſolutely impoſſible, But now as with reſpect to ſuch as remain in<pb n="59" facs="tcp:48995:34" rendition="simple:additions"/>their Ignorance and Unbelief, they are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready deceived, and may ſtill and further be eaſily deceived and beguiled, <hi>Tit.</hi> 3. 3. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 4. Therefore, ſuch, while ſo abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, are none of God's Elect, or Choſen ones. Compare
<hi>Mat.</hi> 24. 24. with <hi>Verſe</hi> 4. 5.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Again, That by [the Elect or Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen] here ſpoken of, ſuch perſons are not intended as ſome dream of, is further mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt: Becauſe it is here ſignified to be a great and provoking Iniquity in thoſe Perſons who were not Choſen, that they were not Choſen; and therefore they are commanded to be caſt into utter darkneſs, <hi>where ſhall be weeping and gnaſhing of teeth,</hi> Mat. 22. 12, 14. Now it is no mans great and damning Iniquity that he was not Choſen in a perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Conſideration before the World was (if any ſuch ſo were, as doubtleſs they were not:) For no man could poſſibly Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute any thing to ſuch an Election, nor poſſibly by any means hinder it; becauſe then he had no being; not only none in a perſonal Conſideration, but alſo not any in the firſt publick Man; for he was Created ſince the Creation of the World. Though it would be a mans unavoidabl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Miſery not to be Choſen in ſuch a ſenſe as ſome plead
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:48995:35"/>for; yet it could be no more his Iniquity, then it would be for a man not to Act before he was a man, or formed of God; or that he was not of God's Privy Counſel when he had no exiſtence, or perſonal being; yea, none in the Loins of the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> nor he any being or exiſtence: Which ſurely is none at all.</p>
            <p n="6">6. And laſtly, Election means not ſuch an Abſolute fore-ordination from Eternity; nor are the Elect the Subjects of ſuch a purpoſe: Becauſe the Elect may make their Election ſure; as the Apoſtle
<hi>Peter</hi> ſignifieth in ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; <hi>Wherefore the rather, Brethren, give diligence to make your Calling and [Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction] ſure,</hi> (firm,
<hi>Heb.</hi> 3. 6. Stedfaſt, <hi>Ver.</hi> 14. even ſtanding and ſetled upon its founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Chriſt; make it valid and of force, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.
17.) <hi>for if ye do theſe things ye ſhall never fall,</hi> 2 Pet. 1. 10. Now certainly, the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute Decrees of God cannot be made more firm or ſtable, more ſure or ſtedfaſt by us: <hi>But the Counſel of the Lord ſhall ſtand for ever: As the Lord of Hoſts hath purpoſed, ſo it ſhall ſtand. What He hath purpoſed who can diſanul, and ſo by conſequence, who can eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh, or make it of force?</hi> Pſal. 33.
11, 12. Iſa. 14. 24, 27.</p>
            <p>By all which it is evidently manifeſted,<pb n="61" facs="tcp:48995:35"/>that God's Election is not ſuch a Purpoſe or Decree of God reſpecting ſome mens Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in a perſonal Conſideration, nor are His Elect the Subjects of ſuch an irreſpective Fore-ordination.</p>
            <p n="1">Object. 1. <hi>But againſt what hath been ſaid, ſome may Object that in</hi> Epheſ. 1. 4. who hath Choſen us in Him before the foundation of the World. <hi>From whence ſome Collect, that the Elect were Choſen be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the World was in a perſonal Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> In Anſwer to what many would prove from this Scripture, we may ſay ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things, which we deſire may be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered. As</p>
            <p n="1">1. Suppoſe we that ſuch a thing could be concluded from this one Scripture, as many do conceive, and are confident may be; which we can by no means grant: Yet when as we have ſeen many Scriptures clearly deny the truth of ſuch a concluſion, whether is it not more reaſonable to hearken to the many ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than unto this one? ſeeing though they be all alike worthy of acceptation, and one Scripture may make a truth evident, yet many concurring make it more evident and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtionable, See <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 14,
15. Suppoſe we that one honeſt and credible perſon ſhould
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:48995:36"/>affirm a thing, and urge it on us to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved; we might give credit to him: But if twenty perſons, every one equally honeſt and credible with that one, ſhould affirm the contrary: Should we not rather believe the truth ſo eſtabliſhed in the mouth of ſo many Witneſſes, than wave them all, and adhere to this one? This Compariſon illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates the matter we are ſpeaking of: Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly the Scriptures in general do with one mouth and conſent diſclaim that notion of perſonal election; and ſhould we deny all for one, if that did ſpeak to the contrary? Which God forbid we ſhould imagine: But mens haſting from all other Scriptures ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about election, and as it were, lightly eſteeming them in compariſon of this one, is a great Argument to me, that the Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on they contend for is ſuch an one as is ſutable to the Spirit of this World, and thoſe evil Thoughts which proceed out of our corrupt Heart; and therefore they haſtily embrace one Scripture which they groundleſly judge is on their ſide; and run away from, and evade the force of twenty to one, every one whereof is of equal Authority: For cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly we are naturally deſtitute of all good, and inclined to all that is evil: <hi>The Lord knoweth and hath declared, that the thoughts<pb n="63" facs="tcp:48995:36"/>of Men, yea of the wiſeſt of them, are vain; every thought in us ſtandeth croſs to the obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of Chriſt and his Goſpel,</hi> Pſal. 94. 11. 1 Cor. 3. 20. 2 Cor. 10. 4,
5.—But,</p>
            <p n="2">2. We further Anſwer, by way of excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Objection, and ſay: This Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture contradicts not at all, no not ſeeming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, what is affirmed by the reſidue; nor affords any relief to them who ſo frequently betake themſelves hereto for refuge: But ſweetly and fully agrees with the reſt men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned: And that we may rightly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand it, let us conſider theſe things.

            <p n="1">1. When they are ſaid to be choſen: This Scripture ſaith not any men were choſen be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the world was Created of God at firſt, but [before the foundation of the world.] Now that may ſignifie,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Either before the Dejection, or Caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down of the World: For ſo the Word tranſlated [<hi>Foundation</hi>] doth properly ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie; and comes from a word that ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, <hi>to Caſt down,</hi> or <hi>Downwards,</hi> Rev. 12. 10. 2 Cor. 4. 9. Now then the Subjects of this Election are ſuch as were Choſen<pb n="64" facs="tcp:48995:37"/>before the Dejection of the World in the Sentence of God, before He denounced the Curſe and Judgment upon the World for the Sin of man. But that was not before the World, but ſince the Fall of <hi>Adam,</hi> and Interpoſition of the Mediator,
<hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 15, 19.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Or as we read it [<hi>before the foundation of the World</hi>] may not ſignifie, before any thing was formed of God; but before the foundation of it as now laid. The World as at firſt made was marr'd by the Sin of man; the Earth and all the Inhabitants thereof were diſſolved: Now Chriſt ſteps in, and makes it again, <hi>John</hi> 1. 10. And is, as it were, the Baſis on which the Pillars of the Earth, or World, ſtand,
<hi>Pſal.</hi> 75. 3. By Chriſt He made the Worlds: God made all things by Him at the firſt, and made them, when they were marred by mans Sin: And He upholds all things by the Word of His Power, having by Himſelf purged our Sins, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 2, 3. And ſo, As <hi>Abel's</hi> blood was ſaid to be ſhed from the foundation of the World, <hi>Luke</hi> 11. 50, 51. So theſe were Choſen before that time, yea, before he was Born: Yea, indeed at that time (as I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive) when Chriſt interpoſed Himſelf, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Fall of man, and in order of Nature<pb n="65" facs="tcp:48995:37"/>after that. And ſo their Election is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded in that Oracle, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 15. And this is the time when they were Choſen: And ſo it was before the Agie, or Secular Times, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 9, 10. <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. 2.</p>
            <p n="2">2. In whom were they Choſen, or in Root? And that is expreſly declared to us [<hi>in Chriſt</hi>] the laſt <hi>Adam:</hi> Therefore it is evident, they were not Choſen in the firſt Man
<hi>Adam,</hi> nor ſo early. For that was not firſt which is Spiritual, but that which is Natural, and afterward that which is Spiritual, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi>
15. 46. Hence Chriſt is called the ſecond Man, who was Interpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed as Mediator after the Fall of the firſt, <hi>Ver.</hi> 47. And as conſidered in Him, and not in the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> or in themſelves, they were Choſen: And this is worthy our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration. But to this we ſhall not Inlarge here, becauſe we may mention it again.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Who are the Subjects of this Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? The Apoſtle ſaith [<hi>Us</hi>] whereby ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther more generally,</p>
            <p n="1">1. He may have reſpect to the Perſons to whom he Writes, and ſuch as are like to them. And ſo the Subjects here ſpoken of are, not any Perſons in a perſonal Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration; but [<hi>the Saints which are at</hi> Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, <hi>and faithful</hi> (or believing Ones, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:48995:38"/>
               <hi>John</hi> 20. 27. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 2.) <hi>in Chriſt Jeſus</hi>] Epheſ. 1. 1. Where alſo he ſhews to us what is the meaning of [<hi>us in Chriſt,</hi>] Ver. 4. Namely, us as Conſidered in this Root of Election and prime Elect, <hi>viz.</hi> Chriſt, and not as we are in our ſelves, or while we abide in our Natural eſtate. And ſo the Subjects of this Election in this dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Deſcription, to wit, [<hi>Saints and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers in Chriſt</hi>] are the ſame with that, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi>
2. 13. <hi>He hath Choſen us from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning in the Sanctification of the Spirit, and Belief of the Truth:</hi> Therefore not before it. And ſo God in Chuſing Chriſt did Chuſe, not any man while out of Him, but all ſuch as ſhould come into, and believe in Him, without difference, or reſpect of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. Now theſe <hi>Epheſians,</hi> who now were Believers, were ſometimes without Chriſt, and then they were not Choſen in Him, becauſe not Believers in Him, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2. 12. with <hi>Chap.</hi> 1. 1. 4. But now believing in Him, after they heard the Word of Truth the Goſpel of their Salvation, they were made of that Generation of Men that were Choſen in Him before the Dejection, or Foundation of the World: <hi>They were now of the Choſen Generation, which in time paſt were not an Elect People, as before,</hi> 1 Pet. 2.<pb n="67" facs="tcp:48995:38"/>9, 10. with Epheſ. 2. 1, 2. They had a new Name given unto them. And in thus un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding it, it appeareth; that God work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth all things according to the Counſel of His own Will; His actual Election, and Elect ones, are ſutable to, and agreeing with His purpoſe, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1. 11.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Or we may look upon the [<hi>Us</hi>] here ſpoken of, in a more eſpecial Conſideration, to have Reſpect and Reference, not to the Believers in general, as being Choſen in Chriſt to Salvation, but to ſome Perſons being Choſen in Him to a more excellent Service and Miniſtration, then were any of the Holy Ones before the coming of Chriſt in the fleſh, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11. 9, 11. And ſo the Perſons here directly ſpoken of and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended are, Chriſt's extraordinary Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadors,
<hi>viz.</hi> The Apoſtles of our Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus. The Apoſtles here magnifies their Office and Service, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 13. And ſignifieth, that as before the Dejection, or Foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the World, God Choſe Chriſt to be the Mediator, Saviour and great Apoſtle, and purpoſed to ſend Him forth in the laſt Ages to make Peace actually for us, and Preach Peace to us: So He reſerved this Honour for His Son, that by Him the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterie ſhould be opened. And in Him He<pb n="68" facs="tcp:48995:39"/>Choſe, not <hi>Paul,</hi> or
<hi>Peter,</hi> as men ſimply conſidered, but the firſt Truſters in Chriſt, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1. 12. to be Inſtruments in this choice Service, and to be ſent forth into the World, as God ſent Chriſt into the World,
<hi>viz.</hi> To Preach the Goſpel according to the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of the Myſterie, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1. 8, 10. And it appeareth this was His Counſel by His Work: <hi>For He worketh all things after, or according to the Counſel of His own Will,</hi> ver. 11. And that theſe are the Perſons here directly ſpoken of appeareth plainly;</p>

               <hi>Firſt,</hi> By the Change of the Perſons: In the two firſt Verſes, the Apoſtle Writeth to the Saints at <hi>Epheſus,</hi> &amp;c. And Saluteth them, <hi>Ver.</hi> 2. [<hi>Grace unto you.</hi>] But then He changeth the Perſons from <hi>Ver.</hi> 3. to <hi>Ver.</hi> 12. And always ſaith [<hi>We, and Us</hi>] and never [<hi>You</hi>] till <hi>Ver.</hi>
13.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> It plainly alſo appeareth, that from
<hi>Ver.</hi> 3. to <hi>Ver.</hi> 12. He ſpeaketh not directly of the Believing <hi>Epheſians,</hi> becauſe He ſpeaks of them that truſted in Chriſt before they were Believers; and it was by the Means and Miniſtration of theſe firſt Truſters they were after brought in, and helped through Grace to Believe, for ſo He ſaith: <hi>That we ſhould be to the praiſe of His Glory, who firſt truſted in Chriſt. In whom<pb n="69" facs="tcp:48995:39"/>ye alſo truſted, or believed, after ye heard the Word of Truth, the Goſpel of your Salvation;</hi> namely, by thoſe firſt Truſters, or ſome of them: See and conſider, <hi>Ver.</hi> 12, 13, 14. And ſurely, this is the clear and direct mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and intendment of the Apoſtle in theſe words. But I ſhall add no more to this place, becauſe it hath been ſpoken to by my Brethren and Companions in the Faith, <hi>viz.</hi> Mr. <hi>Thomas Moor,</hi> ſenior, in his <hi>Explicite Declaration of the Teſtimony,</hi> pag. 263,
274. And pointed unto by Mr. <hi>John Horn,</hi> in his <hi>Open Door,</hi> pag. 122. and in <hi>Reviewer Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viewed,</hi> pag. 83.</p>
            <p n="2">Object. 2. <hi>If any one ſhould further Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject that in</hi> Rom. 9. 11, 13. <hi>to prove their Perſonal Election in a Perſonal Conſideration from; I ſay.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> This doth not at all prove what they alledg it for; And this will appear whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we conſider the words Hiſtorically, or Allegorically. We ſhall ſpeak a little to each Acceptation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Conſider them Hiſtorically, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their firſt and plain Intendment. And ſo,</p>
            <p n="1">1. This was not ſpoken of the Perſons here intended, before the Creation of the World, but in time, and that after <hi>Rebecca</hi>
               <pb n="70" facs="tcp:48995:40"/>had conceived by our Father <hi>Iſaac. And after the Children ſtrugled in her Womb,</hi> Gen. 25. 21, 22, 23. Rom. 9. 10, 12. And ſo it proves not the Election of ſome Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in a perſonal Conſideration before the World was.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Nor was this ſpoken of the Perſons of <hi>Jacob</hi> and <hi>Eſau</hi> onely, but of their Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities alſo, as is moſt evident in what the Lord ſaid to <hi>Rebecca,</hi> when ſhe went to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire of Him. <hi>The Lord ſaid unto her, two Nations are in thy Womb, and two manner of People ſhall be ſeparated from thy Barrels; the one People ſhall be ſtronger then the other Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and the Elder ſhall ſerve the Younger,</hi> Gen 25. 23. And though in <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 11. the Tranſlatours have put in [<hi>the Children</hi>] (whether in favour to that device of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal Election or no, I know not.) Yet theſe words are faithfully ſet down in a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Character, that we may know they are not a part of the Text: But the Verſe ſhould thus be read: For they, or the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions or Peoples, being not yet born, &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="3">3. And it therefore appears, that the Election here ſpoken of, or the purpoſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to it, was not an Abſolute decree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Jacob</hi> Nationally conſidered to Eternal Life, and rejecting
<hi>Eſau</hi> and all his Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity<pb n="71" facs="tcp:48995:40"/>there-from; for neither can we have ſo much faith as to believe the former Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was all Eternally ſaved, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 27. nor ſo little Charity as to conceive the latter was all damned, ſeeing we read of ſome Good men that came from him, as is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable; as <hi>Job,</hi> compare <hi>Job</hi> 1. 1. with
<hi>Lam.</hi> 4. 21. And <hi>Eliphaz</hi> the <hi>Temanite,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare,
<hi>Job</hi> 2. 11. with <hi>Gen.</hi> 36. 9, 11. And his Poſterity might enter into the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of the Lord in the third Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<hi>Deut.</hi> 23. 7, 8. As well as alſo, the Apoſtle ſaith, [<hi>By faith</hi> Iſaac <hi>bleſſed</hi> Jacob <hi>and</hi> Eſau
<hi>concerning things to come</hi>] Heb. 11. 20. But this purpoſe according to Election was, that <hi>Jacob</hi> Nationally conſidered ſhould be preferred before <hi>Eſau,</hi> or <hi>Edom:</hi> That Chriſt ſhould come of them accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Fleſh; and they ſhould have the Word, and Oracles, and Ordinances of God committed to them, which was a great Advantage,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 1, 2. And thus He dealt not with any other Nation,
<hi>Pſal.</hi> 147. 19, 20. And yet in <hi>Eſau</hi>'s ſerving
<hi>Jacob,</hi> he, or any of his Poſterity might be Bleſſed alſo; and might in the third Generation enter into the Lords Congregation, as is ſaid. And ſo now, notwithſtanding that purpoſe in theſe laſt Ages, becauſe of the<pb n="72" facs="tcp:48995:41"/>
               <hi>Jews</hi> unbelief, the Kingdom of God is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from them who were become the Elder People, and given to
<hi>Eſau,</hi> and the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles:</hi> Yet notwithſtanding, if any of the Broken-off <hi>Jews</hi> abide not ſtill in unbelief they ſhall be Graffed in again, <hi>Mat.</hi> 21. 43. compare <hi>Amos</hi> 9. 11, 12. with
<hi>Acts</hi> 15. 14 17. <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 23. And this well agrees with the Scope of the Apoſtle in this place.</p>
            <p>As for that which is mentioned in <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 13. <hi>Jacob have I loved, but Eſau have I hated.</hi> It was Spoken and Written long after <hi>Jacob</hi> and <hi>Eſau,</hi> the Fathers of the two Nations were dead: And declares how God had priviledged the former Nation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the latter according to His purpoſe, in Anſwer to that Demand, <hi>Wherein haſt Thou loved us?</hi> And that hatred of <hi>Eſau</hi> was, however at firſt, but comparative or a leſſer degree of Love, as is ſignified in the Teſtimony of it, <hi>viz. I laid his Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains waſte,</hi> Mal. 1. 2, 3. with Gen. 29. 30, 31.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Conſider we theſe things Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorically: As the Apoſtle ſpeaketh of <hi>Sarah</hi> and <hi>Hagar,</hi> and their Children: Which things are an Allegory, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 22, 24, 31. So here, As <hi>Iſaac,</hi> ſo <hi>Jacob</hi> alſo was a Type of Chriſt,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:48995:41"/>and thoſe Born of Him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 24. 6.
<hi>Gal.</hi> 6. 16. Now before men are Born this is God's purpoſe, that whoſoever believeth in Chriſt ſhould not periſh, but have everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Life: And whoſoever rejecteth Him, though he hath never ſo great a zeal to God otherwiſe, and ſeek and take pains never ſo much to eſtabliſh a Righteouſneſs to himſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>lf, of whom <hi>Eſau</hi> was a Type, ſhall be reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: But this without any diſcriminating Eye or Reſpect to any man in a perſonal Conſideration. And ſo God's purpoſe ſhall ſtand according to Election: Namely, it ſhall abide and take place, not in accepting men into Favour and Fellowſhip with Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, according to their Works of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, but as the Grace of God doth chuſe men out of, and ſever them from the World, into Chriſt, ſo as they are made of His Seed, and reckoned after Him. And this underſtanding of theſe things is ſutable to the ſcope of the Place. For, in Anſwer to the <hi>Jews</hi> who were ready to ſay, there was Unrighteouſneſs with God ſhould He reject them, becauſe they were the Seed of <hi>Abraham</hi> according to the fleſh, and zealous according to the Law, the Apoſtle ſaith; That not all
<hi>Abrahams</hi> Seed according to the Fleſh, nor any in that Conſideration<pb n="74" facs="tcp:48995:42"/>ſimply, were counted for the Seed, but in
<hi>Iſaac</hi> ſhould His Seed be Called, namely, ſuch as are born of the Promiſe in Chriſt by the Goſpel, which no man is till he hath been once Born, <hi>John</hi> 3. 3, 5, 7. For the confirming which he brings in this Inſtance alſo of <hi>Jacob</hi> and <hi>Eſau;</hi> the former a Type of Chriſt, and thoſe who believe through Grace; the latter of the Law-workers, as hath been ſaid, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 6. 11. And this alſo further appears to be the meaning of the place, in <hi>Ver.</hi> 30, 31, 32, 33. where the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſums up briefly and clearly what he had ſaid more largely and darkly. What ſay we then? <hi>(viz.</hi> in what he had foreſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from
<hi>Ver.</hi> 6. to this place; the Anſwer to which Queſtion followeth,
<hi>viz.)</hi> That the <hi>Gentiles</hi> which followed not after Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs have attained to Righteouſneſs, even the Righteouſneſs which is of Faith. But <hi>Iſrael</hi> which followed after the Law of Righteouſneſs hath not attained to the Law of Righteouſneſs. Wherefore? Becauſe they ſought it not by Faith, but as it were by the Works of the Law: For they ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled at that ſtumbling Stone, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
[See Mr. <hi>Thomas Moor,</hi> ſenior, in his <hi>Explicite Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the Teſtimony,</hi> pag. 321. 353. 376. And Mr. <hi>John Horn,</hi> in his
<hi>Eſſays,</hi> pag. 36, 37,<pb n="75" facs="tcp:48995:42"/>And in <hi>Reviewer Reviewed,</hi> pag. 88, 92, 99. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>]</p>
            <p>Thus far we have indeavoured to ſhew [That by Election is not meant, an abſolute Decree of God, reſpecting ſome mens Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in a perſonal Conſideration; nor are God's Elect and Choſen oncs the Subjects of ſuch a purpoſe.] Now we add further,</p>
            <p n="2">2. Nor are the Elect here ſpoken of ſuch as are called ſimply, as that doth ſignifie the Act of the Caller: For God may Call, and thus men may be Called to the moſt High, and yet not ſo Exalt Him as to come unto Him, <hi>Haſ.</hi> 11. 7. God may Call, and men refuſe,
<hi>Prov.</hi> 1. 24. So much is ſignified in the Words, that it is more and a further Buſineſs to be Choſen then to be Called: <hi>Many are Called, but few are Choſen:</hi> Though a man cannot be Choſen but he muſt be Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led (I ſpeak of ſuch as are come to years of Capacity) yet he may be Called and not Choſen. Yea, we may read the words as others do: <hi>Many are the Called.</hi> In ſome ſenſe, namely, the Call may have ſome Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valency upon men, ſo as they may Credit the Report of the Teſtimony of Chriſt, and come amongſt and be reckoned as Members of God's People, and make ſome right ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment and profeſſion of the Faith;
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:48995:43"/>and yet not be Choſen. Not every one that ſaith unto Chriſt, <hi>Lord, Lord,</hi> (either by way of Confeſſion or Supplication) <hi>ſhall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into the Kingdom of Heaven, but he that doth the Will of Chriſt's Father which is in Heaven,</hi> Mat. 7. 21. Men may be ſo far prevailed with by the Call as to deſire to have Chriſt's Name on them and be Hearers of the Word, and make a Trade of Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; they may ſeek Him daily, and frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly tread His Courts, and uſe His Ordinances, and yet not be Choſen in this peculiar ſenſe we ſpeak of, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 4. 1. and 48. 1, 2. <hi>Jam.</hi> 1. 22, 24. The man that had not on the Wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Garment was not Choſen, and yet the Call had ſuch Prevalency upon him, as that he was gathered thereby into the Houſe, or Church of Chriſt, and was there when Chriſt found him, <hi>Mat.</hi> 22. 10, 12. And this is good to be conſidered alſo by us, that we deceive not our ſelves. For we are apt to think, that if we have been Baptized into the Name of Chriſt, and read the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and frequent the Aſſemblies of Gods People, whether publickly only, or alſo privately, and are perſwaded of the Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Truth of that Reported in the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel; and in ſome ſort receive His Grace, and profeſs to know God, that we are certainly<pb n="77" facs="tcp:48995:43"/>in a good and happy eſtate and condition; when as notwithſtanding all this, though we be in theſe reſpects of the Called, we may not be Choſen: Men may be Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, and yet be in the Gall of Bitterneſs, and Bond of Iniquity,
<hi>Acts</hi> 8. 13, 23. Men may be Hearers of the Word and no Doers, and ſo deceive their own ſelves, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1. 22. Men may Believe in vain, and receive the Grace of God in vain, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 2. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 1. Men may profeſs to know God, and yet in Works deny Him, being abominable, and diſobedient, and unto every good Work reprobate, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. 16. Oh therefore! Let none of us deceive our ſelves, in thinking our ſelves to be ſomething when we are nothing. But let every one of us prove, and approve his own Work, and then he ſhall have his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing in himſelf alone, and not in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. 3, 4. Let every one of us ſo receive the Grace of God to purpoſe, that we may be not only of the Called, but of the Choſen ones alſo. And this leadeth us to the Affirmative Anſwer to the Queſtion before propounded (having ſpoken ſo large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the Negative, to ſhew, who are not the Choſen.) <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. The Election here ſpoken of is a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:48995:44"/>ſevered, or gathered out of the World in which men at firſt are; out of the State Principles, Ways, and Works of the World into Chriſt Jeſus: And ſo the Elect are ſuch as for the Excellency of the Knowledg of Chriſt do ſuffer the loſs of all things, and count them but dung, that they may win Chriſt, and be found in Him, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 4, 9.
10. Such they are who are the Called ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to purpoſe; ſuch as ſo Anſwer the Call, and End of God in Calling them, as that they come unto and walk in Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, and after His Spirit: Conſider and compare
<hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 28. with <hi>Ver.</hi> 33, 34. and <hi>Ver.</hi> 1. The Elect or Choſen are ſuch as come unto Chriſt, and ſo come, as that they forſake all that they have for His ſake, that they may have this Pearl of great Price: So it appears in this Parable plainly. The Kings Oxen and Fatlings being killed, and all things ready, he ſends forth his Servants firſt of all to the Firſt-bidden Gueſts, to call them, ſaying, <hi>Come unto the Marriage</hi> namely, to Chriſt, and that Proviſion in Him, as is before ſhewn: Theſe were Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, but not Choſen; they came not to Chriſt that they might have Life: But in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead thereof, they made light of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, and Marriage-feaſt, and Invitation<pb n="79" facs="tcp:48995:44"/>thereto; And (came not, but) went their ways, one to his Farm, another to his Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandiſe; and the Remnant took His Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, and intreated them ſpitefully, and ſlew them: But when the King heard He was wroth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> becauſe they were not Choſen: They did not ſo highly value Chriſt as to prefer Him before the things of this World, and come unto Him, though they were thus Called,
<hi>Mat.</hi> 22. 2, 4, 8, 14. The King then ſends forth His Servants unto the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> to Invite them to come to the Marriage and to gather them into the Houſe, which accordingly they do: And theſe ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally come, and ſo are the Called; but amongſt them ſome are not Choſen; the man was not, which had not on a Wedding Garment, and ſo all like unto him: Name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſuch as though they come, in ſome ſort, into the Houſe, as the Firſt-bidden Gueſts refuſed to do, yet they let not go their own Righteouſneſs, which are as filthy Rags, that they might have the Righteouſneſs which is through the Faith of Chriſt, even the Righteouſneſs of God by Faith, that Robe of Righteouſneſs,
<hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 9. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 61. 10. Or they ſo receive not the Grace of God, as in coming to Chriſt to be Juſtified And Cleanſed (as
<hi>Dan.</hi> 8. 14.) from their<pb n="80" facs="tcp:48995:45"/>Iniquities and Idols, and conformed to the Mind and Image of Chriſt; but while they pretend to ſeek to be Juſtified by Chriſt, they themſelves are found Sinners, as
<hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 17. And ſtill remain altogether, or in a great meaſure, unſanctified in Heart, and unreformed in Life, while yet they profeſs to be Chriſt's Diſciples, and believe His Goſpel. Theſe though of the Called, as the Firſt-bidden Gueſts were not ſo fully, yet are not Choſen, or Elect ones: <hi>And abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ng in this condition will have their portion in the Lake, where their Worm dieth not, and their Fire is not quenched,</hi> Ver. 8. 14. By all which it plainly appears, that the Elect are ſuch as come to Chriſt, and ſo come to Him, as to deny themſelves, and prefer Him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and part with all for His ſake.</p>
            <p>And this is alſo confirmed by the like Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, and our Saviours Inſtructions in <hi>Luke</hi> 14. Where alſo, after the Supper was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared, the Servant is ſent forth to ſay to them that were bidden;
<hi>Come,</hi> for all things are now ready: And they all with one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent began to make excuſe: The firſt ſaid un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, I have bought a piece of Ground, and I muſt needs go and ſee it, I pray thee have me excuſed, And another ſaid, I have bought five Yoke of Oxen, and I go to<pb n="81" facs="tcp:48995:45"/>prove them, I pray thee have me excuſed: And another ſaid, I have Married a Wife, and therefore I cannot come. So the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant came, and ſhewed his Lord theſe things. Then the Maſter being angry, ſaid unto his Servant, go out quickly, <hi>&amp;<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.</hi> to Invite others. And after he had ſignified his great diſpleaſedneſs with thoſe who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed to come to Chriſt when Called, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, None of thoſe men which were bidden ſhall taſte of my Supper, he turned, and ſaid unto the great multitudes that went with him;
<hi>If any man come unto me, and hate not</hi> (comparatively) <hi>his Father, and Mother, and Wife, and Children, and Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, and Siſter's, yea, and his own Life al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, he cannot be my Diſciple. And whoſoever doth not bear his Croſs and come after me, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be my Diſciple. And—whoſoever he be of you that forſaketh not all that he hath, he cannot be my Diſciple,</hi> Luke 14. 16, 21, 24, 26, 33. Which confirmeth what we have ſaid, and is agreeable to the Parable we are conſidering, and ſheweth, that theſe are the Choſen ones who ſo come unto, and after Chriſt, as that they ſell all that they have that they may be made partakers of Him: And o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers that ſo do not, but prefer other things in general, or ſomething elſe in particular be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <pb n="82" facs="tcp:48995:46"/>Him, however they may be Called, or of the Called, yet are not, while ſo doing, of the Elect of Choſen Generation, or the Subjects of God's Election: As we have often ſaid.</p>
            <p>But, God aſſiſting, we ſhall ſpeak hereto a little more particularly and ſhew: What Election and Elect ſignifie in Scripture: And ſo we ſay,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Election doth properly and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently ſignifie, a Chuſing out, or Taking out ſome from others: And the Elect or Choſen are ſuch as are Choſen out of, or from others, and ſo it is here. And for our Underſtanding and Uſefulneſs of the proper and direct Signification of theſe Words and Things, we ſhall propound and give Anſwer from the Scriptures to theſe five following Queries,
<hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">Que. 1. <hi>What is the Argument propounded for the effecting this Election?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> The Grace or Love of God ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted, and everlaſtingly commended to us in this, that He ſent the Son, the Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our of the World, even of Mankind: And according thereto Chriſt came into the World, and was made Fleſh, and was made Sin, and by the Grace of God taſted Death for every man; and is raiſed again for their<pb n="83" facs="tcp:48995:46"/>Juſtification: And hath Redeemed them from the Curſe of the Law, and obtained all the Fulneſs of Grace and Truth into Himſelf for them. This Grace as diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and made known to us by the Miniſtry of the great Kings Servants in and by the glorious Goſpel of the Bleſſed God, is the Argument propounded for Electing men. So in this Parable; to the end the Invited Gueſts might come into Chriſt, and ſo be the Subjects of God's Election, the King commandeth His Servants to tell them: <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, I have prepared my Dinner, my Oxen and Fatlings are killed, and all things are ready, Come to the Marriage,</hi> Mat. 22. 3, 4, 8, 9: with Luke 14. 16, 17. To this alſo agreeth what the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith; even ſo then there is a remnant according to the Election, or Out-chuſing of Grace: A rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant like unto the ſeven thouſand men in <hi>Elias</hi> his days, who had not bowed the knee to <hi>Baal;</hi> not Idolaters and Falſe worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers as the Elect, ſome men ſpeak of may be and continue a conſiderable time: But ſuch as are freed from, and choſen out of ſuch polluted ones, and pollutions; And that, not by Works of Righteouſneſs which they had done, but by the Grace of God which is Saving, or bringeth Salvation to
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:48995:47"/>all men, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 4, 6. And ſo the being Saved,
<hi>viz.</hi> From mens Sins and Idols, is the ſame with this being Elected, or Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choſen; compare and conſider 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2. 10, 12. with
<hi>Ver.</hi> 13. And it is by the ſame Means or Argument effected,
<hi>viz.</hi> By the Grace of God; as the Apoſtle ſignifieth to the
<hi>Epheſians:</hi> For after he had declared what polluted ones they were in Times paſt, namely, before they heard and received the Word of Truth; he then puts them in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance how they got an eſcape from their Pollutions:
<hi>By Grace ye are ſaved.</hi> And again, <hi>By Grace ye are ſaved through Faith, and that not of your ſelves, it is the Gift of God: Not of Works leſt any man ſhould boaſt,</hi> Epheſ. 2. 1, 2, 5, 8, 9. with Rom. 11, 6. Yea, the Lovers of God, and God's Elect, are ſignified to be the ſame Perſons, compare and conſider <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 28. with
<hi>Ver.</hi> 33. Now, How come men to be Lovers of God? Certainly, by the Grace or Love of God, even His firſt Love diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered to them, as the Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> ſaith: <hi>He that Loveth is Born of God, and knoweth God—for God is Love:</hi> But how doth this appear, and whereby i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> evidenced that He is Love? In this was manifeſted the Love of God, becauſe that God ſent His<pb n="85" facs="tcp:48995:47"/>only begotten Son into the World, that we might live through Him.—<hi>He ſent the Son the Saviour of the World.—</hi>And we have known and believed the Love that God hath to us, God is Love, <hi>&amp;c. Hereby is our love made perfect; even through the Knowledg and Belief of His Love, and that He is Love.</hi> And what Love of God is the producer of our love to Him, is alſo declared by the ſame Apoſtle: <hi>We love Him, becauſe He firſt loved us.</hi> It is the Manifeſtation and Diſcovery, not of any delightful, diſtinguiſhing Love of His, but of that great Love wherewith He loved us, and all Mankind; whereby we are begotten to the Love of Him, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in made of the Choſen and Elect Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, 1 <hi>John</hi> 4. 7, 10, 16, 19. with <hi>Epheſ.</hi>
2. 4, 5. And ſo it appears, that the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for effecting this Election is, the Grace of God to Manward diſcovered in the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel of Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="2">Que. 2. <hi>What is the way owned and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved of God in or through which men are Elected?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> The way of His owning and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving is, the Sanctification of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and belief of the Truth, when, and as diſcovered to them: That is, Men are then Choſen, when they ſo with the Heart be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve<pb n="86" facs="tcp:48995:48"/>the Word of Truth, and Grace of God therein diſcovered, as that thereby they are Sanctified and Cleanſed in the Spirit of their Mind, and devoted unto God, and not before. To this purpoſe the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeaketh: <hi>Elect according to the foreknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg</hi> (or Fore-approbation) <hi>of God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> (according to that way fore-owned of Him) <hi>in, or through the Sanctification of the Spirit,</hi> 1 Pet. 1. 2. To which agreeth alſo that of the Apoſtle
<hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Theſſalonians. We are bound to give thanks always to God for you, Brethren, beloved of the Lord, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God hath from the beginning</hi> (viz. of their Goſpels coming to them, as 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi>

No man therefore while he abides in his Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, Unbelief, and Diſobedience of God is Elected or Choſen; nor until he be in ſome meaſure Waſhed and Sanctified in the Name of the Lord Jeſus, and by the Spirit of our God 1

And of which, until they were Choſen out, they were as well as others; and not only in it, but alſo of it: They ſometimes walked according to the courſe of this World, according to the Prince of the power of the Air, the Spirit that now work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in the Children of Diſobedience: <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt whom we alſo had our Converſation in times paſt in the Luſts of our Fleſh.—And were by Nature Children of Wrath, even as others,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle

To this purpoſe ſpeaks our Saviour unto, and concerning his Diſciples: <hi>Ye are not of the World, but I have [Choſen you out of the World.]</hi> And, <hi>I have manifeſted thy Name unto the men which thou gaveſt me [out of the World,]</hi> John 15. 19. and 17. 6. In both which places it is plainly Intimated, that time was that they were (not only in the World in their Perſons, for ſo they ſtill were, nor did our Saviour pray to His Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to take them out of it in this ſenſe, <hi>John</hi> 17. 11, 15. but alſo they were) of the World, as to their State, Condition, Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip, and Demeanour; and during that time they were not Elected, or Choſen out of it. For Gods Elect and Choſen ones,<pb n="88" facs="tcp:48995:49"/>and the world are oppoſed the one to the other, and the former hated by the latter: As alſo our Saviour oft times ſignifieth in ſuch expreſſions as theſe. <hi>If ye were of the world the world would love his own, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ye are not of the world, but I have choſen you out of the world, therefore the world hateth you,</hi> John 15. 18, 19. <hi>Ye ſhall weep and lament, but the world ſhall rejoyce,</hi> Chap. 16. 20. <hi>I pray for them, I pray not for the world, but for them that thou haſt given me out of the world: I have given them thy Word, and the World hath hated them, becauſe they are not of the world, even as I am not of the world,</hi> Chap. 17. 9, 14, 16, 20, 21, 23. 1 John 3. 1, 13.

<hi>Iſa.</hi> 28. 16. And hereby it appears, both that ſome who were before out of Chriſt, and ſo not Elected, after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward were brought into him, and then choſen in him, and reckoned after him. Compare <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 11, 13. with <hi>Chap.</hi> 1. 1, 4. As well as alſo, that ſome are Elected and choſen before other ſome, becauſe ſome are in Chriſt before others,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 16. 7. So in our Types of old: <hi>Abraham</hi> was choſen before his Seed. <hi>God choſe him when he was in</hi> Ur <hi>of the</hi> Chaldees,<pb n="91" facs="tcp:48995:50"/>

And again: <hi>The Lord hath choſen thee to be a peculiar peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple unto himſelf, above all the Nations upon the Earth; a peculiar people Zealous of good Works,</hi> Deut. 7.
6. &amp; 14. 2. with Tit. 2. 14. Hence an Elect Generation and Holy Nation are put together, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 9. And as they are choſen in Chriſt, in the ſanctification of the Spirit, and belief of the Truth, as hath been ſaid: So the end alſo is, <hi>That they ſhould be holy and without blame before him in love:</hi> Eph. 1. 4.</p>
            <p>And ſo he hath choſen them to be, and continue a Spiritual Houſe, an Habitation for himſelf through his Spirit, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 4,
5. And his Houſe they are, who hold faſt the confidence, and the rejoycing of the<pb n="93" facs="tcp:48995:51"/>hope firm unto the end, <hi>Heb.</hi> 3. 6, 14.
<hi>The Lord hath choſen</hi> Zion, <hi>be hath deſired it for his Habitation. This is the reſt for ever: here he will dwell, for he hath deſired it,</hi> Pſal. 132. 13, 14. And as in our Types he did chuſe the Temple to be a place of Habitation, in ſome ſenſe, for himſelf, whence it was often called the Houſe of God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 2. <hi>Chron.</hi> 7.
12. 16. So now thoſe that come unto, and are built upon the foundation of the Apoſtles and Prophets, Jeſus Chriſt himſelf being the chief Corner Stone, they grow unto an Holy Temple in the Lord, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 20, 21. 1
<hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 16, 17. They are, and to that end he hath choſen them,
<hi>that they might be the Temple of the Living God: As God hath ſaid, I will dwell in them, and walk in them; and I will be their God, and they ſhall be my people,</hi> 2 Cor. 6. 16, 18.</p>
            <p>He hath choſen them to bear his name unto, and before others, and to render his praiſe glorious. And as in former times God did chuſe the Temple, that his name might be there forover, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 7. 14. So he hath choſen them that come unto Chriſt, that they might be a Spiritual Prieſthood, to offer Sacrifices, and hold forth the Word of Life to others, and ſo be Inſtruments of good unto others: So it is ſaid of <hi>Paul</hi> after<pb n="94" facs="tcp:48995:52"/>he was Converted. <hi>He is a choſen Veſſel</hi> (or a Veſſel of Election) <hi>unto me, to bear my name,</hi> &amp;c.
<hi>Even to be Chriſts Witneſs unto all men of what he had ſeen and heard: To the End he might be an Inſtrument for opening the Eyes of the blind, both Jews and Gentiles, and turning them from darkneſs to light, and from the power of Satan to God, that they may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reive the forgiveneſs of their ſins, and Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance among them that are ſanctified</hi> (and ſo choſen) <hi>thorow faith that is in Chriſt,</hi> Acts 9. 15. with Chap. 22.
14, 15. &amp; 26. 16, 18. And this is his end alſo more generally in chuſing others, that they might be Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of good to thoſe that as yet are not choſen: As the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> ſignifieth: <hi>Ye are an Elect Generation, a Royal Prieſthood,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>That ye might ſhew forth the Praiſes. If Him that hath called you out of Darkneſs into His marvellous Light.—That whereas o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſpeak evil of you as of evil doers, they may by your good Works which they ſhall behold, glorifie God in the day of Viſitation,</hi> 1 Pet. 2. 9, 10, 12. So <hi>Simeon</hi> elſe-where declared, how God at the firſt did viſit the
<hi>Gentiles,</hi> to take out of them a People for His Name; and ſo to Build again the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle of <hi>David</hi> which was fallen down, <hi>&amp;c. That the reſidue of men might ſeek after<pb n="95" facs="tcp:48995:52"/>the Lord;</hi> and together with them be happy alſo in finding Him, <hi>Acts</hi> 15. 14, 17. with <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55. 6, 7, 8. <hi>Mat.</hi> 7. 7, 8.</p>
            <p>And ultimately, He hath Choſen them, that they might obtain the everlaſting Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt. So the Apoſtle
<hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>God hath from the beginning Choſen you unto Salvation,</hi> &amp;c. 2 Theſ. 2. 13, 14. And again, <hi>I indure all things for the Elects ſake,</hi> (<hi>viz.</hi> for Chriſt's Bodies ſake, which is the Church) <hi>that they alſo may obtain the Salvation which is in Chriſt Jeſus, with eternal Glory,</hi> compare 2 Tim. 2. 10. with Col. 1.
24. and Epheſ. 3. 13.</p>
            <p>And ſo God's Elect here ſpoken of are ſuch, as by the diſcovery of the Grace of God in Chriſt by the Goſpel are brought in, and prevailed with to believe through Grace; And in that believing Sanctified by the Spirit; Choſen out of the World into Chriſt; delivered out of the power of Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and Satan, and removed into the Kingdom of Gods dear Son; that they might be; and continue to be (and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly in ſome meaſure they are) a ſpecial Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple unto Him here, an holy People, an Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation for God who is their Portion, to ſhew forth His Virtues, and be to Him for a Name, and a Praiſe, and a Glory, for the<pb n="96" facs="tcp:48995:53"/>good of the reſidue of men among whom they are ſet and preſerved: And might here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, and being faithful to the death ſhall, <hi>Inherit that Inheritance incorruptible, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defiled, and that fadeth not away, reſerved in the Heaven for them, who are kept by the Power of God unto Salvation,</hi> &amp;c.
1 Pet. 1. 2, 5.</p>
            <p>And ſo indeed Gods Elect are ſuch as are redeemed by the Blood of Chriſt, out of others amongſt whom they dwell, and of whom ſometimes they were, <hi>Rev.</hi> 5. 9. 10. Hence whereas in one place it is ſaid,
<hi>They that were with the Lamb, were ſuch as were redeemed from the Earth, and from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong men:</hi> In another it is ſaid, <hi>They that are with the Lamb are Called, and Choſen, and Faithful,</hi> compare Rev. 14. 1, 4. with Chap. 17, 14. And ſo, the Lord hath ſet a part for Himſelf, or (as the Vulgar Tranſlation reads it) Choſen to Himſelf the man that is Godly;
<hi>Even ſuch as Worſhip him in Spirit and in Turth,</hi> Pſal. 4.
3.—And this is the firſt ſenſe of Election, A Chuſing out.</p>
            <p n="2">2. To Chuſe, doth ſometimes in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſignifie the ſame with Appoint, or Command: And ſo to be Choſen, doth ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie, one who Obeys, or Obſerves the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, or Appointment of another: So it
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:48995:53"/>is taken, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15. 15. <hi>David</hi>'s ſervants ſaid unto the King; <hi>Behold, thy ſervants are ready to do whatſoever my Lord the King ſhall appoint,</hi> or [<hi>Chuſe</hi>] as in the Margin. So again, 1 Sam. 19. 38. <hi>Whatſoever thou ſhalt require, or
[Chuſe] of me, that will I do for thee.</hi> And thus it may be well here alſo taken in this place: <hi>Many are Called,</hi> viz. Unto Chriſt by the Goſpel, in the faithful Miniſtration thereof by his Servants. Many are by the King commanded to come, but few are Commanded, Ruled, or Appointed by Him; but too many of them are Unruly and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedient to the Goſpel; or though ſome yield feigned Obedience unto Him, and after a ſort receive His Grace, yet they receive it in vain: So it is in this Parable: <hi>The King ſent forth his Servants to call them that were bidden to the Wedding, and they would not come:</hi> They would not have the Man Chriſt Jeſus to Reign over them. Again, <hi>He ſent forth other Servants,</hi> when all was actually done and prepared to ſay unto them; <hi>Come unto the Marriage: But they made light of it,</hi> &amp;c. And though the man that had not on the Wedding Garment came into the Houſe, yet he came not after the Appointment of the King; he did not from the Heart obey that form of Doctrine delivered in the <pb facs="tcp:48995:54" rendition="simple:additions"/>Goſpel, <hi>Mat.</hi> 22. 3, 4, 5, 8, 13. This is His Commandment and Appointment, and that which He requireth of us in the Goſpel, when it is Preached to us; <hi>That we believe on the Name of His Son Jeſus Chriſt, and love one another.</hi> But the moſt to whom the glad tidings of the Goſpel are Reported, and unto whom theſe Commandments are given by the Lord Jeſus, will not come to Chriſt that they might have Life: And they are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore condemned becauſe they obey not the Goſpel, in believing on the Name of the only begotten Son of God, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3. 23. with <hi>John</hi>
3. 18. <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 16. and 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1. 8, 9. God is faithful in Calling men in due time, to the end they might come to the Knowledg of the Truth: But alas, few there are who receive and obey His Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment, but the greateſt part remain ſons of <hi>Belial</hi> in Heart, ſuch Perſons as will not take Chriſts Yoke upon them, nor learn of Him, though His Yoke be eaſie, and His Burden light, and His Commandments are not grievous; <hi>But give a with-drawing, or back-ſliding ſhoulder:</hi> And ſo remain unruly, and uncommanded Perſons, ſuch as will do whatſoever goeth forth out of their own Mouth; and will not be appointed and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered by Him, and the Light and Inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons<pb facs="tcp:48995:54" rendition="simple:additions"/>of His Grace, which teacheth that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying ungodlineſs and worldly Luſts, we ſhould live Soberly, Righteouſly, and God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in this preſent world, <hi>Zech.</hi> 7. 11.
<hi>Jer.</hi> 44. 16, 17. 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5. 14. <hi>Tit.</hi> 2. 11, 12. And this underſtanding it well agreeth with, and is ſutable unto the former ſenſe given.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Choſen, or Elect, ſignifieth choice ones, and ſuch as are more Excellent then others, more Precious and Eminent then others. Hence we have [Choſen and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious] twice joyned together, and both op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed in one Verſe to diſallowed, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 4, 6. So Choſen and Diſpiſed are oppoſed the one to the other, <hi>Jam.</hi> 2. 5, 6. So whereas in one place it is ſaid, <hi>A good Name is rather to be [Choſen] then great Riches.</hi> In another it is ſaid, <hi>A good Name is [Better] then precious Oyntment,</hi> compare Prov. 22. 1. with <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 9. 1. To ſignifie, that ſuch Perſons or Things are the Subjects of Election which are better then others. Thus it is ſaid of Chriſts Spouſe:

<hi>Beloved,</hi> or <hi>Loved,</hi> with a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful and peculiar manner of Love: So it is ſaid, <hi>The Sons of God ſaw the Daughters of men that they were fair, and they took them Wives of all that they choſe,</hi> viz.
<hi>delighted in, or were well pleaſed with,</hi> Gen. 6. 2. So theſe two words, Choſen and Delighted in, are uſed indifferently: <hi>They have Choſen their own Ways, and their Soul delighteth in their abominations,</hi> Iſa. 66. 3, 4. So whereas in the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> it is thus ſaid: <hi>Mine Elect in whom my Soul delighteth:</hi> That Scripture is thus read and rendred by the Evangeliſt <hi>Matthew: My beloved, in whom my Soul is well pleaſed,</hi> compare Iſa. 42. 1. with Mat. 12. 18.

In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed God loves all men, while it is called to day, <hi>with a love of pity and compaſſion, with a love of mercifull kindneſs, and hath abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly manifeſted it, in that he hath given his only begotten Son to be the Saviour of the World,</hi> Joh. 3. 16. &amp; 4. 42. And as is evident in what he doth unto them thorow Chriſt: Thus he loves them who hate him, and hath there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore propounded himſelf as an example to be imitated by us, to the end we might ſo ſee and follow him, <hi>as to love and be mercifull to our Enemies, and bleſs them that curſe us,</hi> &amp;c.

So he ſaith concerning <hi>Ephraim: All their wickedneſs is in</hi> Gilgall,

Truly God ſo loveth his Son Jeſus Chriſt, becauſe he laid down his life for us that he might take it up again, that he loves all them that love him with a delightful love; they are his choſen ones, with whom he is well pleaſed: <hi>He gives unto them Eternal Life,</hi> John 3. 16, 18.

            <p n="1">1. To preſerve, or redeem us from that evil and hurtful Notion and Doctrine of perſonal Election in a perſonal conſideration, which ſome call the Goſpel of Election; In which Men think and teach, that God hath from Eternity Decreed and purpoſed a ſet determinate number of Perſons in a perſonal conſideration to Believe and be ſaved: And that all ſuch ſhall in due time be brought in to Believe, and be Converted by an invin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible and irreſiſtable Power: And that Men may be of this number, and the ſubjects of this purpoſe, who are Fornicators, Idolaters, Adulterers, Effeminate, Abuſers of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with Mankind, Theeves, Covetous, Drunkards, Extortioners, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Yea, and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutors, Blaſphemers, and Injurious ones, while abiding ſuch: Yea, that ſome abiding ſuch till almoſt their departure out of this world, are yet, and continue the Elect of God, and his Choſen ones.</p>
            <p>This is a very groundleſs, &amp; Scriptureleſs, and Pernicious Doctrine; And that which renders the Croſs of Chriſt, fooliſhneſs. For

And he that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leiveth not (the goſpell while and as it is preached to him) ſhall be damned. God<pb facs="tcp:48995:63" rendition="simple:additions"/>hath determined and decreed, that ſuch as unfeignedly beleive his Goſpell, and abide faithfull to the death, ſhall have eternall life: And ſuch as abide impenitent, and unbeleiving ones, or after they have belei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved turne aſide to their crooked pathes, and abide therein to the end, ſhall be deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with an everlaſting deſtruction. And this was his purpoſe before men were born,
<hi>John.</hi> 3. 14-18. <hi>Marke</hi> 16. 15, 16. But this reſpects not men in a perſonall conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, nor neceſſitates one man to beleive, or another not to believe: But it was pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed without difference, or reſpect of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. But, I ſay, reſpecting men in a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonall conſideration, the doctrine of Gods election ſheweth, that no mans ſtate is fixed or unalterable, before he came into the world, and much leſs from eternity, or before the world was: No, nor while they are joyned to all the living, and the day of Gods grace and patience laſteth. Indeed, when men are cut off from the land of the living, then there is a great gulfe fixed, ſo as there is no paſſing from one ſtate or place to another. <hi>Luk.</hi> 16.
25. As the tree falleth ſo it lieth (and ſo it ſhall riſe and remaine for ever.) Whether it fall toward the South, or to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the North: In the place where the tree<pb facs="tcp:48995:63" rendition="simple:additions"/>falleth there it ſhall be.
<hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 11. 3. Thoſe that dye in union with Chriſt ſhall be ſo rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and be ever with him: And thoſe that dye in their ſins and out of Chriſt, ſhall be ſo raiſed, and periſh for ever from his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence: And the conſideration hereof might awaken and Ingage us all, that while it is an acceptable time, and day of ſalvation, we receive the grace of God to purpoſe, even to be ſaved thereby: For there is no work, nor device, nor Wiſdome, nor knowledge in the grave whither we are going.
<hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 9. 10, And not to neglect the preſent time; conſidering alſo, our times are in Gods hand, and we cannot boaſt our ſelves of the morrow, for we know not what a day may bring forth. Our times are in Gods hand: In his hand is the ſoule of every living thing, and the breath of all mankind. And Behold he breaketh downe, and it cannot be built againe: he ſhutteth up a man, and there can be no opening. If he cut off, and ſhut up, or gather together, then who can hinder him? <hi>Prov,</hi> 27. 1.

<hi>Acts</hi> 26. 18. This Doctrine of Gods Election, as it is declared to us in the Scriptures of truth, is a ſweet and comfortable Doctrine, agreeing with the whole Goſpel of Chriſt; It leads us to mind and conſider the preciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and neceſſity of the Blood and Sufferings of Chriſt, without which there could have been no Remiſſion of Sins, nor Eternal Life; But all muſt have gone to Hell without difference, or reſpect of Perſons,
2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 14. And that if Chriſt had not been raiſed again, we had been yet in our Sins, and Preaching, Faith, and Hope had been all in vain, 1
<hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 12. 20. It ſheweth unto us, that the Goſpel of Chriſt is the Power of God, in which his Arm is put forth for pulling men, and choo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing them out of the world into Chriſt, And that ſuch as obey it are bleſſed, and ſuch as reject it, judge themſelves unworthy of Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1. 3, 5. 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2. 13, 14. <hi>Acts</hi>
13. 46. And ſo leads us to glorifie the word of the Lord. It ſheweth unto us, that ſuch as are Elect may poſſibly fail of the Grace of God, if they abide not in Chriſt, <hi>John</hi> 15. 2. 6. 16-19. And ſo inſtructeth us, <hi>to paſs the time of our ſojourning here in fear:</hi> To have and hold faſt Grace, <hi>whereby we may ſerve God acceptably with Reverence and Godly fear, for<pb facs="tcp:48995:65" rendition="simple:additions"/>our God is d conſuming Fire;</hi> And ſo preſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us from high-mindedneſs, preſumption, and licentiouſneſs, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 16-29.

            <p>But what ſaith the Doctrine of Gods Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to ſuch a deſpairing, ſorrowful one?

Yet it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clareth good news, and true news to ſuch an one; it daubeth him not up with untemper'd morter, nor telleth him he may be one of Gods Elect, though a wicked perſon, and unbeliever; But it aſſureth him the contrary: And yet ſhews him, both that while it is called to day he may through grace believe; And in ſo doing, ſhall have a new name gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven unto him: And though formerly he were not Elected, yet now ſhall be one of Gods Elect. This ſheweth that ſuch as were not his People, may be his People; and that ſuch as were not beloved or Elected, may become<pb facs="tcp:48995:67" rendition="simple:additions"/>beloved and Elected, which is the ſame as we have ſhewed, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 25, 26. That ſuch as were not his children, may become his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and ſhall ſo do, in believing in Chriſt, as the Scripture hath ſaid: For, <hi>To as many as receive him, to them he gives the right and priviledge to become the Sons of God, even to them who believe on his name,</hi> Rom. 9. 26. with <hi>John</hi> 1. 12. 13. 1
<hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 9, 10. And thus God in his Doctrine doth create the fruit of his lips, Peace, Peace, to him that is far off, to ſuch ſtout-hearted ones as are far from righteouſneſs: To the end they might for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake their unrighteous wayes and thoughts, and return to him, and he will have mercy upon them, and multiply to pardon them, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 57. 19. with chap. 46. 12,
13. &amp; chap. 55. 6, 7, 8. Therefore though this Doctrine ſaith, <hi>Wo to the wicked,</hi> that men might hear and fear, and not continue ſuch: Yet it cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth to the wicked, look unto Chriſt and be ye ſaved: Come unto him and he will give you reſt.

And hence he thus expoſtulateth with ſuch as had ſold themſelves for their Iniquities, and for their tranſgreſſions were put away; Wherefore when I came was there no man? when I called was there none to anſwer?

               <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is true indeed, they are cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen by Chriſt who are elected, and cannot chuſe themſelves by any Wiſdome, Strength, or Works of Righteouſneſs of their own: But it is alſo as true, that in thoſe things appertaining to the Salvation of the Soul in which they are Paſſives, yet there is ſomewhat required of them, as God is preventing them with his Grace: As to ſay, <hi>They cannot beget, or bring forth them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, but the Work of the new Birth is the Work of God,</hi> John 1.
13. Jam. 1. 18. But yet it is ſignified, that ſomething in order hereto is required of Men, not in any wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, or ability of their own, for they have none: But as God is preventing and aſſiſting them with power and capacity; namely to hear the Word of Truth, and to be hearty Believers and doers of it, <hi>John</hi> 1. 12. 13. with <hi>Jam.</hi> 1. 18, 19, 22, 25.
<hi>John</hi> 3. 3, 5, 7. So in the ſenſe before ſpoken of,
<pb facs="tcp:48995:71" rendition="simple:additions"/>Men cannot reconcile themſelves to God, but it is the Work of God by Chriſt to reconcile us to himſelf: And yet ſomething is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of men: Hence the Apoſtle ſaith. <hi>We pray you in Chriſt ſtead be ye reconciled to God,</hi> 2 Cor. 5. 18, 20. So here; Though God in Chriſt be the firſt chuſer, and by him we are choſen; yet ſomething is required of us in the ſtrength he gives, that we may be choſen out of the world, ruled by him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come choice ones, and be the ſubjects of his peculiar love, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And though we find not this command any where,
<hi>Be ye choſen,</hi> in expreſs words given unto us; yet we have the ſame thing in other expreſſions given in commandement to us: As, <hi>Be ye ſaved,</hi> Iſa, 45. 22. <hi>And ſave your ſelves,</hi> Acts 2. 40. Whereby the ſame thing is intended as is foreſhewn, in comparing 2
<hi>Theſ.</hi> 2. 10, 12. with <hi>verſe</hi> 13. And, <hi>Be ye ſeperate;</hi> which in another Scripture is rendred, and read,
<hi>Choſen;</hi> As alſo hath been noted by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring <hi>Deut.</hi> 10.
8. with <hi>Chap.</hi> 18. 5. and 21. 5. And <hi>Levit.</hi> 20. 24, 26. with
<hi>Deut.</hi> 14. 2, 3. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 17. And we may ſee this is required of men that they may be <hi>Choſen</hi> even to come to Chriſt, in which doing they ſhall be made of the choſen Generation, though formerly they have not ſo been. As<pb facs="tcp:48995:72" rendition="simple:additions"/>alſo hath been ſaid before, and may be ſeen in comparing 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 4, 5. with <hi>verſe</hi>
9. 10. And to the end we may come unto Chriſt, and ſo be choſen, and pluckt out of the world; needfull it is,</p>
            <p n="1">1. To hear the Word of Chriſt; this is the firſt, and one thing needfull unto the ſaving of the Soul, <hi>Luke</hi> 10. 39, 42. It is good and needfull for us to chuſe this good part: As God is ſpeaking to us, and open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our Ears, even to hear in hearing: <hi>For ſaith,</hi> in which men are choſen, <hi>cometh by hearing, and hearing by the Word of God,</hi> viz. <hi>by the Goſpel of Peace, and glad tydings of good things,</hi> Rom. 10. 14, 15, 17. with 2 Theſ. 2. 13. It is the work of the Father by his Spirit, to glorifie Chriſt, and to bear witneſs of him: He ſpeaketh excellent things unto us concerning him, and the opening of his lips are right things. And together herewith he both gives unto men capacity of hearing, and calls upon them to hear, <hi>Prov.</hi> 8. 4, 6, 17, 20. He ſaith; <hi>Hearken diligently unto me, and eat ye that which is good, and let your Soul delight it ſelf infatneſs: Incline your Ear, and come unto me, hear, and your Soul ſhall live,</hi> Iſa. 55. 1, 3. Let every man be ſwift to hear, <hi>viz.</hi> the Word of Truth, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1. 18, 19,
<hi>The hour is coming,<pb facs="tcp:48995:72" rendition="simple:additions"/>and now is,</hi> ſaith our Saviour, <hi>that the dead ſhall hear the voice of the Son of God and they that hear ſhall live,</hi> John 5. 25. And this is the firſt Branch of the deſcription of him that paſſeth from death to life, from an Eſtate of wrath and miſery, into a ſtate of favour and bleſſedneſs; he that heareth Chriſts word, <hi>John</hi> 5. 24.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Needfull alſo it is, that we learn of the Father, that we may be Choſen, not onely that we hear, as that is diſtinguiſhed from learning: But that alſo we heartily em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace his heavenly leſſon and doctrine: So, after Wiſdome had called upon men firſt of all to hear, ſhe after ſaith alſo; <hi>Receive my inſtruction and not Silver, Prov.</hi>
8. 6.—10. Indeed God teacheth many that are not taught by him, and ſo they deprive their ſoules of good, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 48. 17, 18, But it is needfull, to the end we may be elected, that we receive the inſtruction of our Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly father, even to buy the truth, and not ſell it: even to buy it with an under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valuing, and parting with, and forſaking all that we have, that we may be made par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of Chriſt, <hi>Prov.</hi> 23. 23. with
<hi>Luk.</hi> 14. 33. And every one that is taught of God, every one that hath heard and learned of the father cometh unto Chriſt. <hi>Job.</hi> 6. 45.
<pb facs="tcp:48995:73" rendition="simple:additions"/>with <hi>Matth.</hi> 22. 3, 4, 5. And ſo ſhall be cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen, and a ſubject of Gods election. And let no man be diſcouraged from coming un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Chriſt in this way, becauſe of his former vileneſs and wretchedneſs; for though he be the chief of ſinners that cometh, yet him that cometh <hi>he will in no wiſe caſt out, but will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive ſuch an one graciouſly: he will chuſe him, and not caſt him away, Iſay</hi> 41.
9. with <hi>Joh.</hi> 6. 35. And as the wrath of God is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed from heaven againſt all ungodlineſs and unrighteouſneſs of men who hold the truth in unrighteouſneſs; ſo as perſiſting in ſuch like iniquity he will at laſt reject ſuch, and give them up to a reprobate mind: <hi>Reprobate Silver ſhall men call them</hi> (who after all means uſed, yet will not come to Chriſt, who is the reſt and way to it) <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Lord hath rejected them,</hi> Rom. 1. 18, 28. Jer. 6. 16, 17, 30. So alſo all ſuch as hear the joyfull ſound ſounded forth by the Father in the Goſpel, and receive his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction ſo as to come unto Chriſt. <hi>Such ſhall find reſt,</hi> Mat. 11. 28, 29. <hi>Their Souls ſhall live,</hi> Iſa. 55. 3. And they ſhall have fellowſhip and partnerſhip with Jeſus Chriſt, in him be choſen, and after him reckoned; And ſhall, abiding in Chriſt, inherit the Kingdom which God hath prepared for them<pb facs="tcp:48995:73" rendition="simple:additions"/>that love him, and look, and wait for his coming from Heaven, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 8,
9.</p>
            <p>Yea, this Doctrine of Gods Election may alſo admoniſh and warn them who are in Chriſt Jeſus, not to depart from him. Upon this preſumption, that the Elect can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not poſſibly be deceived: For certainly, it is poſſible for them ſo to be, and they will cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly ſo be if they abide not in Chriſt by Faith and Love: As our Saviour ſaith, <hi>If a man abide not in me, he is caſt forth as a Branch, and is withered, and men gather them, and they are caſt into the fire, and they are burned,</hi> John
15. 6. In which words our Saviour ſignifieth, that ſuch as have been ingraffed into himſelf, who is the true Vine, by his Father the Husbandman, may not abide in Chriſt, but may ſo depart from him, as not only to be caſt into the fire, which a man may be, and yet be plucked out again, as a brand out of it, <hi>Jude</hi> 23. But alſo be burned; that is, he may finally periſh. And to the ſame purpoſe the Apoſtle ſpeaketh to the believing <hi>Romans,</hi> who were in, and did ſtand in the Root of Righteouſneſs: <hi>Thou ſtandeſt by faith, be not high minded, but fear; for if God ſpared not the natural Branches, take heed alſo leſt he ſpare not thee. Behold therefore the goodneſs and ſeverity of
<pb facs="tcp:48995:74" rendition="simple:additions"/>God, on them which fell ſeverity; but towards thee goodneſs, if thou continue in his goodneſs, otherwiſe thou alſo ſhalt be cut off,</hi> Rom. 11. 20, 22. Men, as before we have ſeen, are the ſubjects of Gods election, in coming unto, and abiding in Chriſt. <hi>And in him all the Promiſes of God are Yea, and Amen,</hi> 2 Cor. 1. 20. <hi>And if we be Chriſts, then are we</hi> Abrahams <hi>Seed, and Heirs according to Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe: And ſo an elect Generation,</hi> Gal. 3. 29. with Deut. 7. 6, 9,
10. &amp; 10. 15. <hi>And they who dwell in this ſecret of the moſt high, ſhall abide under the ſhadow of the Almighty,</hi> Pſal. 91. 1, 12.
<hi>They that truſt in the Lord ſhall be as Mount</hi> Zion, <hi>which cannot be removed, but abideth for ever: And the Lord will do good unto thoſe that be good, and to them that are upright in their hearts: But as for ſuch as turn aſide</hi> (out of the path of the juſt) <hi>to their crooked paths, the Lord ſhall lead them forth with the workers of iniquity; but peace ſhall be upon</hi> Iſrael, Pſal. 125. 1, 4, 5. with Pſal. 73. 1. Therefore the Apoſtle <hi>Peter,</hi> writing to them who were elect according to the fore-knowledge of God the Father, and had obtained like precious faith with the Apoſtle, exhorts them to give diligence to make their calling and election ſure; for ſaith he, <hi>If ye do theſe things ye ſhall never<pb facs="tcp:48995:74" rendition="simple:additions"/>fall;</hi> plainly ſignifying to us, that otherwiſe they might and ſhould fall, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 2. with 2
<hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 1, 10. Thoſe that are with Chriſt on Mount <hi>Zion,</hi> are ſuch as are Call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and not only ſo but <hi>Choſen;</hi> yea, and not only <hi>Choſen;</hi> but faithfull alſo: <hi>Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully following the Lamb whereſoever he goeth,</hi> Rev. 17. 14. with Chap. 14. 1, 4. Oh that we may never ſay, We are the Elect of God, and our Mountain is ſo ſtrong ſetled that we ſhall never be moved, however we demean our ſelves: But that we may be of the Sheep of Chriſt, and abide ſuch, hearing conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually the voice of our Shepheard, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing him; for to ſuch as ſo do he will give Eternal Life, and they ſhall never pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, neither ſhall any pluck them out of his hand; neither Death, nor Life, nor An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, nor Principalities, nor Powers, nor things preſent, nor things to come: Nor heighth, nor depth, nor any other Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, ſhall be able to ſeperate them that love God, and keep his commandments, from the love of God, which is (for ever in Chriſt Jeſus, <hi>John</hi> 10. 27, 28, 29, with <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.
28, 33, 39.</p>
            <p>And ſo much to the firſt Particuler, in which we have endeavoured from the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to ſhew, what is not, and what is Gods Election; and who are not, and who<pb facs="tcp:48995:75" rendition="simple:additions"/>are the ſubjects of it. And now we come to ſhew,</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>That few of the many that are called are choſen:</hi> as our Saviour here plainly affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth: But few of many, (as
<hi>Jer.</hi> 42. 2.) even of the many which are called by the Servants in the plain Preaching of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, as it is now revealed: For that our Saviour ſpeaks of and intends ſuch, by the [<hi>Many</hi>] here, we have before ſhewn; and deſire that may be conſidered, and what is contained in the three Cautions foregiven. Now of theſe many who have the Scriptures of Truth amongſt them, which have been ſpoken and recorded by the Servants, the extraordinary Servants of the great King, <hi>viz.</hi> by the Holy Prophets, and Apoſtles of our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt. And amongſt whom alſo are ſome of his Servants preſerved and continued, even ſuch as have believed on Chriſt thorow the Apoſtles word, he here ſaith, <hi>Few are choſen, few compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratively to thoſe ſo called; Few to the many who ſay they are</hi> Jews <hi>and are not. There are threeſcore Queens, and fourſcore Concubines, and Virgins without number: But my Love, my undefiled is but one,</hi> ſaith our Lord Jeſus: <hi>She is the onely one of her Mother, ſhe is the choice and choſen one of her that bare her,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:48995:75" rendition="simple:additions"/>Cant. 6. 8, 9. In this ſenſe alſo it is true, and may be thus taken; As the Lilly among the Thorns, ſo is Chriſts love among the Daughters; one Lilly among many Thorns, one Love amongſt many Daughters, other Profeſſours, Churches, and Societies, <hi>Who ſwear by the Name of the Lord, and make mention of the God of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>but not in Truth, non in Righteouſneſs; for they call themſelves of the Holy City,</hi> &amp;c. Cant. 2. 2. Iſa. 48. 1, 2. And as was alſo fore-propheſied.
<hi>In that day, ſeven women</hi> (Churches, or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations) <hi>ſhall take hold of this one Man, Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> (1 Tim. 2. 5.) <hi>ſaying, we will eat our own Bread, and wear our own Appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell,</hi> (as the Man did that had not on the Wedding Garment.) <hi>Only, let us be called by thy name</hi> (Chriſtians) <hi>to take away our reproach,</hi> Iſa. 4. 1.

               </gap>t may be applied to theſe choſen ones, the <hi>Iſrael</hi> of God, which was ſpoken of
<hi>Iſrael</hi> after the fleſh, a Type of the Spiritual Seed. <hi>The Lord did not ſet his love upon you, nor chuſe you, becauſe ye were more in number than any people, for ye were the feweſt of all people; not counted worthy in reſpect of the<pb facs="tcp:48995:76" rendition="simple:additions"/>ſmallneſs of their number to be reckoned amongſt the Nations of Profeſsours,</hi> Deut. 7. 6, 7. Chriſt's flock of actual believers, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right followers of Him, is <hi>a little flock.</hi> Luk. 12. 32. I ſtill mean, as compared with the many or multitudes which are called, and in ſome ſort alſo, the called. And ſo much our Saviour giveth us to underſtand in His Parable which He ſpake in His per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal Miniſtration. In one He ſaith, <hi>The Kingdom of Heaven is like unto a Net that was caſt into the Sea, which gathered of every kind, ſome good, and ſome bad.</hi> Mat. 13. 47-49. And in another He more plainly and evidently ſignifieth, that of the many to whom the Goſpel is preached, but few comparatively obey it from the heart, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue ſo to do.</p>
            <p>One ſort of the hearers of the Kingdom He compareth to the Way-ſide ground, and and like to it many abide: The word hath little or no entrance into, or impreſſion on them, in reſpect of any willing reception of it from them. The ſower indeed ſoweth his ſeed in the hearts of this firſt ſort of ground, And did they ſuffer it to take place in them, and enter into, and abide in their hearts, they ſhould believe and be ſaved: But they underſtand it not, conſider it not,<pb facs="tcp:48995:76" rendition="simple:additions"/>ſet not their hearts to it, open not to let in this bleſſed ſeed, which would convert them in ſo doing; but letting it lye above ground, it is open unto, and fit to be taken away by the Fowls; And the wicked one cometh, and catcheth away that which was ſown in the hearts of ſuch, leſt they ſhould believe and be ſaved: Of this ſort ſo abiding it may be ſaid; <hi>It is a People of no underſtanding, therefore He that made them will not have mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy upon them, and He that formed them will ſhew them no favour,</hi> Matth. 13. 18, 19. <hi>with</hi> Luke 8. 11, 12. Iſa. 27. 11.</p>
            <p>Another ſort of hearers He likeneth to ſtony places, or to the rock: they hear the word of the Kingdom, and the glad tidings therein declared: And in ſome meaſure un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand it: And ſo are not like unto the Way-ſide hearers; for anon, or immediately with joy they receive and gladly entertain it: And do believe for a while what is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in reported, That Chriſt is indeed the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour of the World: But theſe have no root in themſelves; they ſuffer not the word to ſink deep enough to break the ſtone or rock at the bottom, and to effect in them an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt and good heart, which it would do, were it with the heart believed. <hi>Is not my word like as a fire, ſaith the Lord, and like an bammer<pb facs="tcp:48995:77" rendition="simple:additions"/>that breaketh the rock in peices,</hi> Jer. 23. 28, 29. this is powerful to convert and change the Soul, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19. 7. But they ſuffer it not to take root downward, but ſtill retain ſome ſtone at the bottom, ſome deſign or enterprize of theirs unbroken: And though poſſibly in hearing this word gladly, they do many things which it is effecting in them, part with many things thereby re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved, and do many things which are good in themſelves, yet there is ſtill ſome one beloved iniquity or other which they will not let this good and powerful word morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie and root up; ſome luſt or idol remains at the bottom of their hearts, which hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders the ſeed from ſinking deep enough, and and ſo in concluſion the Word becometh un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fruitful.
<hi>Herod</hi> knew <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt</hi> was a juſt Man, and an holy, and obſerved him (or kept him from danger) and when he heard him he did many things, and heard him gladly: But when <hi>John</hi> reproved him for
<hi>Herodias</hi> his Brother <hi>Philip's</hi> Wife, and ſaid, <hi>it is not lawful for thee to have her;</hi> he turned not at this reproof of God's inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; he ſuffered not the word of God to purge out and root up this iniquity, but was angry with this faithful reprover, and firſt put him in Priſon, and afterwards cauſed<pb facs="tcp:48995:77" rendition="simple:additions"/>him to be beheaded,

<hi>Come, I pray you and hear what is the word that cometh forth from the Lord: And they come unto thee, ſaith the Lord, as the People cometh, and they ſit before thee as My People, and they hear thy words, but they will not do them; For with their mouth they ſhew much love, but their heart goeth after their Covetouſneſs: And <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>e thou art unto them as a very lovely ſong of one that hath a pleaſant voice, and can play well on an inſtrument: for they hear thy words but they do them not: For ſtill from the leaſt to the greateſt of them every one was given to Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſneſs,</hi> Ezek. 33. 30-32. Jer. 6. 12. Thus it is with too many now in our days; they hear the glad-tidings of good things brought to them in the Goſpel of peace; and by and by they receive them with gladneſs; And they are perſwaded that the word of Chriſt is a <hi>faithful ſaying, and worthy of all acceptation;</hi> And they marvel at the graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous words therein contained, and wonder that every one doth not give credit thereto. But ſtill they believe in vain; and though they have ſome love for what they hear, yet they love ſome thing reproved thereby rather and better; they hold faſt a lye in their right hand, while the truth is but<pb facs="tcp:48995:78" rendition="simple:additions"/>in their left; they ſet and keep up ſome ſtumbling block of iniquity in their hearts; ſome intemperance, or uncleanneſs, or ſtrife, or covetouſneſs, or pride, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And by the deceitfulneſs of that ſin which doth ſo eaſily beſet them, they harden their hearts like an Adamant ſtone, ſo that the word ſinks not deep enough into them; And this is after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards made apparent: For when tribulation or perſecution ariſeth for the word, by and by they are offended: As immediat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>y at firſt they received the word of the kingdom with joy; ſo immediately in time of trial and temptation they are offended, and fall away.—<hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 19. 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2. 10. <hi>Iſa.</hi>
44. 20. <hi>Matth.</hi> 13. 20, 21. with <hi>Luke</hi> 8. 13.</p>
            <p>A third ſort of hearers appear in conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to be like the thorny ground, they are ſuch as hear the word, and receive the ſeed: And, it may ſeem, for ſometime receive it to purpoſe, and it brings forth fruit in them. Theſe underſtand as the Way-ſide hearers do not: Theſe have ſome root in themſelves, as the Stony-ground hearers had not: Theſe bring forth fruit; but afterward without any good reaſon or cauſe, they go out and depart from Chriſt Jeſus, and from the mindfulneſs of His Grace and Goſpel,<pb facs="tcp:48995:78" rendition="simple:additions"/>and abide not faithful unto the death: Theſe endure not unto the end, though at firſt they did run well: They continue not rooted and grounded in the Faith: They abide not in Chriſt ſtedfaſt and unmoveable, but forſake the Lord the fountain of living waters, and wander out of the way of underſtanding, and turn aſide to their crooked pathes, after they have eſcaped the pollutions of the world thorow the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and Doctrine of our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt; And ſo are like Birds that wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der from their Neſts: they are removed from him that called them into the Grace in Jeſus Chriſt: And after they have clean, and indeed, eſcaped from them that live in er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, yet they ſin willingly, and erre from, and forſake the right way, in which abiding they ſhould be ſaved: But they go forth, <hi>Luke</hi> 8. 14. and then the Thorns enter in, <hi>Mark</hi> 4. 19. They were not there always: they were, it may ſeem, rooted out and caſt forth by the Plow of the Goſpel: And had they abidden in Chriſt they had been ſtill preſerved from them. For, <hi>Whoſoever abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth in Him ſinneth not;</hi> He keepeth Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf that the wicked one toucheth him not,
<hi>in whom the ſeed of God remaineth,</hi> 1 Joh. 3. 6, 9. <hi>with</hi> Chap 5. 18. But going out,<pb facs="tcp:48995:79" rendition="simple:additions"/>the cares of this world, and the deceitful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of riches, and luſts of other things enter in, <hi>and choak the Word,</hi> and it becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth unfruitful; namely, in concluſion, they bring no fruit unto perfection, none to the harveſt; And ſo none which will abide and appear on their account in the day of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt. Theſe may endure ſome of them a conſiderable time, and even al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt, though not altogether, unto the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt: And how far ſoever they go, or how long ſoever they continue; yet not enduring unto the end, not overcoming and keeping Chriſt's Works unto the end, but going out and departing from Him, and ſo perſiſting, all their righteouſneſs ſhall not be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred, but for their iniquity that they have committed they ſhall dye for it: there is no reaping if men faint, how long ſoever they have exerciſed themſelves in well doing, <hi>Matth.</hi> 13. 22. with <hi>Mark</hi> 4. 18,

12-16. <hi>Luke</hi> 9. 62. Oh that the conſideration here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of may admoniſh and provoke us all, <hi>To be ſtedfaſt, unmoveable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, knowing</hi> (in thus doing and continuing)
<hi>our labour ſhall not be in vain in the Lord:</hi> But Chriſt will preſent us in the body of His fleſh, unblameable and unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bukeable, if we continue in the faith rooted and grounded, and be not moved from the hope of the Goſpel, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 1 Cor. 15. 58. Col. 1. 22, 23. Gal. 6. 9. ſo ſhall we not be like the thorny-ground hearers.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, Some there are who receive the Word into the <hi>good ground,</hi> even ſuch as hear the Goſpel and underſtand: And therein they are better then the firſt ſort of hearers com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
<pb facs="tcp:48995:80" rendition="simple:additions"/>to the way ſide. And they receive the ſeed in an honeſt and good heart; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they are preferred before the ſecond ſort of hearers, who are compared to the ſtony ground. Yea and alſo they keep it, and bring forth fruit with patience and perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance: In a patient continuance in well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doing, they ſeek for Glory and Honour, and immortality: And unto them in due ſeaſon God will render eternal Life, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.
6, 7. Theſe all bring forth fruit unto per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, though not all alike; but
<hi>ſome an hundred fold, ſome ſixty, and ſome thirty:</hi> Yet they continue keeping the ſeed, <hi>the good Word of God,</hi> and ſuffering it to bring forth fruit in them, and to make them fruitful even unto the end. And herein they are differenced from, and do more worthily then, the third ſort of hearers, compared to the thorny ground. Though they indeed for ſome time, yea poſſibly for ſome conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable ſpace of time, ſome of them how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, did retain the word of the kingdom; but before the harveſt came they grew weary, &amp; fainted in their minds, &amp; ſo deprived them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of that reward of the inheritance of which otherwiſe they might and ſhould have partaken: And ſo are compared to, and in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion, become like the <hi>thorny ground;</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare <pb facs="tcp:48995:80" rendition="simple:additions"/>Matth. 13.
18-23. <hi>with</hi> Mark 4. 14-20. &amp; Luke 8. 11-15.</p>
            <p>Now in this Parable our Lord confirms the truth of what He affirms in the Parable we are conſidering a part of; to wit, that few of the many who are called are choſen: Among the many hearers of the word of the kingdom, there were three ſorts that in concluſion received the grace of God in vain: And one ſort only that received and retained the love of the truth to be ſaved thereby: Our Saviour in this Parable of the ſeveral grounds, ſpeaks not of the heathen, who have not the Oracles of God committed to them, nor the Goſpel of Chriſt plainly preached among them: nor of ſuch as hear ſuch inſtructions as cauſe to erre from the words of knowledge, and ſuch fooliſh ones as have not the lip of knowledge: For no good fruit can be expected from ſuch fooliſh per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and ſuch Doctrines: And therefore the Holy Ghoſt hath councelled us to go from the preſence of ſuch vain talkers; and to ceaſe to hear ſuch inſtructions which are ſo hurtful, <hi>Prov.</hi> 14. 7. &amp; 19. 27. But He ſpeaks of ſuch perſons as were hearers of the good Word of God, the word of Truth, the Goſpel of our Salvation, which was ſpoken unto them, and ſown in the hearts of them<pb facs="tcp:48995:81" rendition="simple:additions"/>by the good ſower, the Son of Man: And yet amongſt theſe hearers there are but few who are the called according to purpoſe: Oh how few are there that are indeed re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed from the Earth, and from amongſt men, and who faithfully cleave unto, and follow the Lamb that was ſlain whitherſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he goeth!</p>
            <p>And the Reaſon why there are ſo few choſen is not (as we have ſaid, and may again alſo ſhew) becauſe the moſt were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probated, or paſt by in a perſonal conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from Eternity: Or becauſe, no true and ſaving Grace was vouchſafed unto them, for both theſe are falſe: But becauſe they ſtrive not, or abide not ſtriving to enter in at the ſtrait gate: But againſt all the diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries, convincements, reproofs and opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Spirit in the Goſpel, walk on in, or return again unto, <hi>the broad way,</hi> in which there are ſuch multitudes who hold faſt deceit, and refuſe to come unto Chriſt in His way. So much our Saviour ſignifieth when He ſaith unto His Diſciples,
<hi>Enter ye in at the ſtrait gate; for wide is the gate, and broad is the way that leadeth to deſtruction, and many there be that go in thereat.</hi> Why ſo? <hi>Becauſe ſtrait is the gate, and narrow it the way which leadeth unto Life, and few there<pb facs="tcp:48995:81" rendition="simple:additions"/>be that find it,</hi> Matth. 7. 13, 14. And again, when one ſaid unto Chriſt, <hi>Lord, are there few that be ſaved?</hi> (Though our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our gives not a direct Anſwer, yet He ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth in His Anſwer, That few compara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively are ſo; and intimately declareth, That mens not being willing to enter in at the ſtrait gate, or not to do it in the preſent time, is the Reaſon: For) He ſaid (not to him only that propounded the Queſtion, but indefinitely) unto them that heard Him: <hi>Strive to enter in at the ſtrait gate, for many, I ſay unto you, will ſeek to enter in and ſhall not be able,</hi> Luke 13.
22-24. He doth not here ſignifie that there was no gate, for ſuch as in the event go to deſtruction; nor that it was not opened, but plainly giveth us to underſtand that there was a gate, and that it was ſo opened that any man might enter therein, <hi>Joh.</hi> 10. 9. Yea that it was held open all the day of Chriſt's mediation, in that it preſently followeth; when once the maſter of the Houſe is riſen up, and hath ſhut to the door, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Luke 13. 25. clearly implying, That the door was not ſhut until that time, to wit, while the day of God's Grace and Patience is continued, and men are joyned to all the living: But He evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſignifieth that the reaſon why few are<pb facs="tcp:48995:82" rendition="simple:additions"/>ſaved is, becauſe they ſtrive not, or will not ſtrive to enter in at this ſtrait gate,
<hi>Ezek.</hi> 33. 31, 32. The gate is indeed ſtrait; A Man in entring muſt deny and renounce himſelf daily, his ſinful and fleſhly luſts that war againſt the Soul: his wiſdom, righteouſneſs, will, deſigns, and enterprizes: his covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and love of the World, and the things thereof: his deſires of vain-glory, praiſe, and honour of Men, and friendſhip of this World: his eaſe and pleaſure: his inordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate affection to neareſt and deareſt relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, yea and to his own life alſo; Yea and whatſoever doth hinder him, or would turn him aſide from coming unto, and following after Jeſus Chriſt. And the <hi>way is narrow which leadeth unto life;</hi> it is an afflicted, perſecuted way, and thoſe that walk in it muſt <hi>thorow much tribulation enter into the Kingdom of God,</hi> Acts 14. 22. <hi>They that will live godly in Chriſt Jeſus ſhall ſuffer Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> 2 Tim. 3. 11, 12. Chriſts Diſciples and Followers, I mean ſuch as are His Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples indeed, <hi>ſhall be hated of all Men for His name ſake:</hi> not only of profane ones, though they will be the ſong of the Drunkards, and the by-word of baſe nameleſs Men, who are viler then the Earth: but alſo the appearingly righteous and zealous ones will reproach and<pb facs="tcp:48995:82" rendition="simple:additions"/>villifie them, and the Doctrine profeſſed by them, and caſt out their names as evil for the Son of Man's ſake; their Mothers Children will be angry with them, <hi>Cant.</hi>
1. 6. their Brethren will hate them, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 66. 5. And the Sons of the Sorcereſs, the ſeed of the Adulterer and the Whore, ſuch as are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten of divers and ſtrange Doctrines, will ſport themſelves againſt them, and make a wide mouth, and draw out the tongue againſt them, <hi>Iſa.</hi>
57. 3, 4. ſo that in coming unto, and following after Jeſus Chriſt, they can expect nothing but frowns, cruel mock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, reproachful words and geſtures, ſcoff<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, afflictions and perſecutions from all that are not of their own company: He that is not with them is againſt them: ſo that they that will come after Chriſt, muſt not only deny themſelves, but alſo take up their croſs daily and follow him. For God hath predeſtinated and fore-ordained that all that are lovers of Him, <hi>who are the called according to purpoſe,</hi> and ſo Gods Elect ones, ſhould be conformed to the Image of His Son, that He might be the firſt-born among many Brethren: That as He was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed and rejected of Men, a Man of Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows, and acquainted with grief, ſo they alſo ſhould be made like unto Him, and
<pb facs="tcp:48995:83" rendition="simple:additions"/>drink of the ſame cup whereof He drank, <hi>Matth.</hi>
16. 24, 25. <hi>Luke</hi> 9. 23, 24. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 28, 29-33. Now becauſe moſt of them who are called by the Goſpell when they hear this ſaying are offended, crying out in their hearts at leaſt, <hi>This is an hard ſaying, who can hear it?</hi> as they <hi>Job.</hi> 6. 60. and will not ſtrive to enter in at this ſtrait nor walk in this nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row way which is ſo perſecuted; hence it comes to paſs that Chriſts flock of actual and unfeigned believers is a little flock, and ſmall amongſt the thouſands of ſuch as are called, and call themſelves by the name of Chriſt. And ſo we have ſeen the truth of our Saviours ſaying in this place, elſe where confirmed, and have conſidered and ſhewed the reaſon thereof, why few of the many called ones are choſen.</p>
            <p>And this aſſertion and inſtruction of our Saviours, <hi>That few are choſen,</hi> may be of uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs unto us.</p>
            <p n="1">1. To ſhew unto us how little reaſon they who hear and believe the Goſpel with the heart, have to glory or boaſt of the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of them that come amongſt them, and who are called thereby: ſeeing they know from the teſtimony of Chriſt, that of thoſe many to whom the joyful ſound is proclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, few unfeignedly entertain it, or yeild up
<pb facs="tcp:48995:83" rendition="simple:additions"/>themſelves to the ſaving operations of it. Indeed it may be matter of gladneſs to them, that many do come to hear the Goſpel of peace: for how can Men believe on Chriſt, if they hear not the Doctrine concerning Him? But when they wiſely conſider, That many who are called by the Goſpel are only ſo, and will not come to Chriſt that they may have life, it occaſions ſadneſs unto them, and keeps them ſober, and preſerves them from glorying in the numerouſneſs of them who come amongſt them. Other perſons who glory in appearance, and not in heart, are apt to be lifting up, and priding them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in their great companies, and in the many hundreds that come to hear the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines of ſuch as conſent not to wholſome words, the Words of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and the Doctrine according to Godlineſs. But alas, for thoſe who are indeed the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Chriſt, they have ſo many occaſions of ſorrow and fighing preſented to them, even amongſt ſuch as are profeſſedly one with them, that inſtead of boaſting of their num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, rivers of Waters run down their eyes, becauſe ſuch keep not Gods Law, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 136, And ſometimes thoſe who are in any good meaſure upright, are ready to take up that wiſh of the Prophets: <hi>Oh that we had <pb facs="tcp:48995:84" rendition="simple:additions"/>in the Wilderneſs a lodging place of Way-faring Men, that we might leave the generality of our Brethren profeſſedly, and go away from them,</hi> as
<hi>Jer.</hi> 9. 2, 3. For though, as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>they have all heard,</hi> and many of them oftentimes heard, <hi>the Goſpel of Chriſt;</hi> yet they have not all obeyed the Goſpel, for <hi>Iſaias</hi> ſaith, <hi>Lord who hath believed our report?</hi> Rom. 10.
14-16-18. Joh. 12. 37, 38. Oh how few are there who from the heart obey that form of Doctrine that hath been deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered to them! <hi>The Kingdom of Heaven,</hi> in the gracious and ſpiritual adminiſtration of it, <hi>is like to a Net caſt into the Sea, that ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thereth of all kinds:</hi> But how few are willing to be drawn out of their Elements into Jeſus Chriſt! And to forſake, and go on to forſake all, that they may be and continue His Diſciples indeed! Were this conſidered, it would preſerve them from glorying in their number, and cauſe them rather to ſay; <hi>Woe is us, for we are as when they have gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the gatherings of ſummer, as the grape glean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the Vintage, there is no cluſter to eat,</hi> Mich. 7. 1,

            <p n="2">2. It might alſo awaken and provoke us all, To examine our ſelves in the Glaſs of the Goſpel, and ſee whether we ourſelves are only of the many called, or whether we be<pb facs="tcp:48995:84" rendition="simple:additions"/>alſo of the few who are choſen. Indeed, if all who are called by the plain and faithful miniſtration of the Goſpel were choſen alſo, we might ſave our ſelves this labour, and reſt ſecure and well ſatisfied, that we are of the remnant according to the election of Grace: Or if the greateſt part of the called ones were elected alſo, it might nor ſo greatly concern us to ſearch and try our ſelves, and inquire ſo diligently into this matter: But when our Lord, who is the truth it ſelf, ſaith, <hi>few of thoſe invited by the Servants are choſen,</hi> it greatly concerns us to try ourſelves, that we may not think our ſelves to be ſomething when when we are nothing, and ſo deceive our ſelves; which will be the ſaddeſt and miſerableſt cheat and of the moſt pernicious and everlaſtingly deſtructive conſequence that ever was, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. 3, 4. <hi>Examine your ſelves whether ye be in the Faith, prove your own ſelves; know ye not your own ſelves that Jeſus Chriſt is in you, except ye be reprobates?</hi> 2 Cor. 13. 5. What a ſad thing will it be for us to ſport our ſelves in our ſelf-deceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, as too many do? 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 13. Better it is now for us to deal faithfully with our ſelves, then to flatter our ſelves, or be flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered by others to our endleſs and eternal miſery and calamity. Come we then to<pb facs="tcp:48995:85" rendition="simple:additions"/>the light of the Lord, the Goſpel of Chriſt, and therein and thereby we may ſee our ſelves, whether we be choſen no, <hi>Even he that is an hearer of the word and not a doer, is like unto a man that beholdeth his natural face in a Glaſs; for he beholdeth himſelf:</hi> Even as a man may ſee his natural face in a Glaſs, and ſee whether it be clean and free from ſpots and pollution or no: ſo a man that is only called by, and an hearer of the word of Truth, may ſee himſelf, and ſee what manner of perſon he is, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1. 22,
23, 24. He may ſee whether he be choſen out of the World by the Grace of God, or whether he be not, but ſtill remain in, or be turned back again into the World, and ſo is at preſent rejected of God, and not loved with peculiar manner of love: As the Apoſtle intimateth, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 5. And if by this Glaſs we ſee we are hearers, and of the called only, Oh let us give no reſt to our eyes, not ſlumber to our eye-lids, until we ſo receive and retain the Grace of God which brings Salvation to us, that we may be choſen out. of this miſerable condition, and redeemed from amongſt Men, that it may be well with us for ever, and we may not periſh with the World. And if it appear that we are of the number of thoſe who are choſen,

<hi>Hereby we know that we know Him, and are in Him, if we keep His Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments,</hi> 1 Joh. 2. 3-5. <hi>And he that keepeth His Commandments dwelleth in Him, and He in him,</hi> chap. 3. 24. that is to ſay, in more and plainer words; <hi>His Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are, That we believe on the Name of Jeſus Chriſt, and love one another as He hath given us Commandment,</hi> 1 Joh. 3. 22-24.

            <p n="1">1. By this, <hi>That the Faith they have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, is the Faith of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and according thereto, they believe with the heart that good report the Father hath given <pb facs="tcp:48995:86" rendition="simple:additions"/>of Chriſt in His Word and Sayings; in which He hath teſtified; <hi>That He ſent the Son into the World, not to condemn the World, but that the World thorow Him might be Saved:</hi> And ſo they believe on the Name of the Son of God, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 16-18. they have their Faith begotten by, cloſing with, and foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded on, not Mens Doctrines, or their own Thoughts and Imaginations, which they know to be corrupt and evil: But they have received and retain for their Faith, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe then the Word of God and Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of Jeſus, which was witneſſed by the holy Prophets in former times, and is now revealed to us by the Apoſtles of our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt: And ſo they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve on Chriſt as the Scripture hath ſaid and teſtified of Him; and not as Men in their Gloſſes and Interpretations ſpeak of Him. They call no meer Man whatſoever their
<hi>Rabbi,</hi> nor own any to have dominion over their Faith but Jeſus Chriſt, and God in Him: He is their only Law-giver in this reſpect, the Father of their Spirits, the Lord of what they believe: And ſo accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to His teſtimony they believe Him to be the Son of God, the Saviour of the World, the only Foundation of Faith and Hope, the only Fountain of all the fulneſs of Grace<pb facs="tcp:48995:86" rendition="simple:additions"/>and Truth, the only Bread and Water of Life, the only door of approach of God, the only Lord of our Faith and Conſciences, the only High Prieſt and Mediatour between God and Men: And according hereto, they come unto and depend on Him in His way, for bottoming all upon Him, for receiving all from Him, for living continually by Him and to Him, for approaching to God thorow Him, and expecting and waiting thorow His Spirit for His perfecting all that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And ſo they hold forth this word of Life in Word and Converſation. And he that thus believeth on the Son hath the Witneſs in Himſelf, and gives not God the lye, but hath ſet to His Seal that God is true in all He hath teſtified of His Son, 1 <hi>Job.</hi> 5. 10, 11. <hi>Job.</hi> 3. 33. And in receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this Teſtimony of Jeſus, they receive alſo therewith certainly and undoubtedly the Spirit of Gods Son, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 2-5. <hi>which Spirit beareth Witneſs with their Spirit,</hi> with their enlightened mind and judgment,
<hi>that they are the Sons of God,</hi> Rom. 8. 16. <hi>And hereby they know that they dwell in Him, and He in them, becauſe he hath given them of His Spirit: And they have ſeen</hi> (in the light, and by the evidence thereof)
<hi>and do reſtifie, that the Father ſent the Son to be the

<hi>our Goſpel came not unto you in word only, but alſo in power, and in the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And ye be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came followers of us, and of the Lord, having received the word in much affliction with joy of the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And they were alſo taught of God to love one another, and all Men:</hi> Hereby they knew the election of theſe
<hi>Theſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalonians:</hi> firſt it was the Apoſtles Goſpel which was heartily received by them; and that not as the word of men, but as the word of God: And this wrought effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in them, to turn them, and they did turn unto God from all their Idols, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1. 3, 4-10. &amp; 2.
13. &amp; 3. 12, 13. &amp; 4. 9, 10. And whatever zeal men may have, or what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever reformation be wrought in them, or whatever profeſſion they make, or conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation they have: Yet if they hear, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace not Gods Words, if they receive not the Faith of Chriſt as His Faith, they are not of God,
<hi>Joh.</hi> 8. 47. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4. 6. <hi>Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever tranſgreſſeth and abideth not in the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine<pb facs="tcp:48995:89" rendition="simple:additions"/>of Chriſt hath not God,</hi> 2 Joh. 9. On though men do in ſome ſort believe the Word of God and Teſtimony of Jeſus; yet if this be not yielded up unto, and ſuffered to work effectually in them, they do believe in vain, and they are vain men, 1

14-20, 22, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Yea and by this Faith and Love, and the Fruits and Effects thereof, as being held forth unto, and before others; even thoſe who are of the World may know, that thoſe that walk in this Faith which worketh by Love, are Chriſts Diſciples indeed, and ſo Gods Elect ones: they are Chriſts Diſciples known and read of all Men, being by theſe two, manifeſtly declared ſo to be, even to ſuch as hate them, and therefore make war with them which keep the Commandments of God, and have the teſtimony of Jeſus Chriſt, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 2, 3. with <hi>Rev.</hi> 12. 17. &amp; 14. 12.
<hi>By this ſhall all men know that ye are My Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,</hi> ſaith our Saviour, <hi>if ye have Love one to another,</hi> Joh. 13. 34, 35. But we ſhall add no more to this uſe.</p>
            <p n="3">3. In that the Elect and choſen ones of God are few, it ſheweth unto us the wonderfulneſs of Gods care concerning them, and protection over them, in preſerving ſuch an handful <pb facs="tcp:48995:89" rendition="simple:additions"/>amongſt ſo many enemies: They are like a Lilly amongſt many Thorns, <hi>Cant.</hi> 2. 2. like a Turtle Dove amongſt a multitude of birds of prey, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 74. 19. And yet they are and ſhall be preſerved, becauſe they have a ſtrong redeemer, and a careful and faithful Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard, who will keep them and preſerve them from this generation that hates them, and that for ever, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 12. 7. <hi>If it were not the Lord who were on their ſide, they may always ſay: if it were not</hi> Jehovah <hi>who is on their ſide, when men riſe up againſt them; they had been often ſwallowed up quick, when mens wrath was kindled againſt them,</hi> Pſal.
124. <hi>But God is for them, and who then can be againſt them?</hi> Rom. 8.
31-33, 34. <hi>The Lord is their Shepheard, and they ſhall want no good thing: And their Salvation is of the Lord, He is their ſtrength in the time of trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: And He ſhall help them and deliver them, He ſhall deliver them from the wicked, and ſave them becauſe they truſt in Him,</hi> Pſal.
23. &amp; 37, 39, 40. And hence alſo,</p>
            <p n="4">4. This inſtruction contains conſolation and incouragement in it againſt cauſe and occaſion of fear and diſcouragement: That the Elect are few, cauſeth fear to them: hence they are incouraged and ſtrengthned againſt their fear occaſioned by the ſmallneſs<pb facs="tcp:48995:90" rendition="simple:additions"/>of their number. <hi>Fear not little flock,</hi> Luk. 12. 32. <hi>fear not thou worm</hi> Jacob, <hi>and ye few men of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 41. 14. But that theſe few are choſen, choſen out of the World, choice ones in Gods account, and loved with delightful, well pleaſed, everlaſting love, this is proper and powerful to ſtrengthen them againſt the fear of evil; And to encourage them to lift up the hands that hang down, and the feeble knees. Hence ſuch incouragements and conſolations are propounded to them as theſe: <hi>thou art My ſervant. I have choſen thee, and not caſt thee away: fear thou not, for I am with thee, be not diſmayed, for I am thy God,</hi> Iſa. 41, 8, 9, 10-14.
<hi>Hear now, O</hi> Jacob <hi>My ſervant, and</hi> Iſrael <hi>whom I have choſen: Thus ſaith the Lord that made thee and formed thee from the Womb, which will help thee: fear not, O</hi> Jacob <hi>My ſervant, and thou</hi> Jeſhurun <hi>whom I have choſen: fear not, neither be afraid,</hi> Iſa.
43. 1-5. &amp; 44. 1. 2-8. The ſmallneſs and littleneſs of their number might occaſion them to think God will take no notice of them: But the conſideration of what is here affirmed of this ſmall company, that they are choſen, choſen of God and precious in His eſteem, is incouraging unto them: He will take them, though but one of a City, and two of
<pb facs="tcp:48995:90" rendition="simple:additions"/>a Family, and will bring them to <hi>Zion,</hi> Jer. 3. 14. Thou haſt a few names even in <hi>Sardis which have not defiled their Garments: And they ſhall walk with me in White, for they are worthy,</hi> ſaith our Saviour, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. 4. And though He ſift the Nations among whom they are like as Corn is ſifted in a ſieve: Yet ſhall not one Corn, no not the leaſt Grain, fall to the Earth, <hi>Amos</hi> 9. 9, 10. And that they are choſen may cauſe them to lift up their head againſt the evil and fear of their Enemies; And aſſure them that God will avenge them in due time. <hi>Who ſhall lay any thing to the charge of Gods Elect? It is God that juſtifieth,</hi> &amp;c.—<hi>Who ſhall ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate us from the love of Chriſt? ſhall tribulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or diſtreſs, or perſecution, or famine, or nakedneſs, or peril, or ſword? nay in all theſe things we are more then Conquerours thorow Him that loved us, and whoſe Elect we are,</hi> Rom. 8. 33-37-39. And ſhall not God avenge His own Elect, which cry unto Him day and night though He bear long with them? I tell you, ſaith Chriſt, <hi>He will avenge them ſpeedily,</hi> Luk. 18. 7, 8. Yea though they are few in number, yet becauſe they are choſen, they may be confident God will provide what is good for them while they are here in this World: And hence our <pb facs="tcp:48995:91" rendition="simple:additions"/>Saviour ſaith, <hi>Fear not little, little flock,</hi> fear not Enemies, fear not Wants and Neceſſities, <hi>for it is your Fathers good pleaſure to give you the Kingdom;</hi> And therefore aſſuredly He will give you meat, drink and cloths, and no good thing will He withhold from you in ſeeking His Kingdom rather then any other thing,
<hi>Luk.</hi> 12. 31, 32, 33. with <hi>Jam.</hi> 2. 5.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Seeing that few of the called are cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen, it may preſerve us from being deceived by myſtery <hi>Babylon</hi> (and any other like her) who flatters and perſwades others, telling them that ſhe is the holy Catholick Church: And that ſuch as joyn themſelves unto, and abide in Communion with her, are the true Sons of the Church, and in a good and happy condition: And living and dying therein ſhall be happy for ever. Alas, how plainly doth it appear that ſhe is miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably miſtaken, and ſuch as liſten to her; By what our Saviour here ſpeaks, and ſpeaks Prophetically of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> alſo, amongſt whom few are choſen. It may be more readily and reaſonably believed, That very few amongſt them are called by the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants in the plain and faithful declaration of the Goſpel of Chriſt, (ſeeing they ſteal away the word of the Lord, in the Records of
<pb facs="tcp:48995:91" rendition="simple:additions"/>them from the people, as alſo others do in their vain and fooliſh interpretations and gloſſes) then that many, or moſt of them are choſen, and ſhall hereafter inherit eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life. And it is good for us rather to mind what the Holy Ghoſt ſaith unto us, then to liſten to her lies, dreams and deluſions, who ſaith, <hi>If any man Worſhip the Beaſt, and his Image, and receive his mark in his forehead, or in his hand, the ſame ſhall drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is poured out with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out mixture into the cup of His indignation: And he ſhall be tormented with Fire and Brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone in the preſence of the Holy Angels, and in the preſence of the Lamb; And the ſmoak of their Torment aſcendeth up for ever and ever,</hi> &amp;c. Rev. 14. 8, 9, 10, 11. &amp; chap. 18. 4, 5, 6.</p>
            <p n="6">6. That few of the called are choſen, may be uſeful alſo to preſerve us from ſuch, and ſuch like ſayings as theſe,
<hi>viz.</hi> [Every man is bound by the commandment of God to believe that he is choſen in Chriſt to Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; eſpecially he that profeſſeth Faith in Chriſt: And when we ſay every man is bound to believe this, we except none, no not the reprobates, who neither at any time do, nor can believe in Chriſt; And if the reprobate believe it not, he ſinneth moſt
<pb facs="tcp:48995:92" rendition="simple:additions"/>grievouſly of all.] Oh how Evil and Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous are ſuch expreſſions! And what oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion do ſuch perſons give to others to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve them in nothing they ſay? Theſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, who thus ſpeak, deny that Chriſt died for all, and yet they tell us [every man is bound to believe that he is Elected in Chriſt:] And how falſly do ſuch ſpeak, as will appear, if we briefly conſider? 1. That which is to be believed in this ſaying is a manifeſt lye, as with reſpect to the moſt of men even amongſt the called ones alſo, as is ſhewed; And ſo ſuch perſons even ſay in ſuch like expreſſions, That moſt men are bound to believe a lye. 2. It is ſuppoſed in this ſaying, that every one is bound to believe that he is Elected in Chriſt [by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of God.] In which ſaying they firſt ſignifie, That the God of truth doth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand men to believe a lye: Oh fooliſh charge! And then alſo they belye Him in ſaying, they are bound by His Command ſo to believe; when as He never commanded them, nor came ſuch a thing into His mind. 3. In this former ſaying alſo is intimated; That if the reprobate do not believe he is Elected in Chriſt, he ſins moſt grievouſly of all: And ſo it is ſignified, the moſt heinous iniquity in the reprobates (as they call <pb facs="tcp:48995:92" rendition="simple:additions"/>them) is, that they believe not a lye; And for this they ſhall be damned hereafter: How contrary is this to what is ſpoken in the Scripture of truth! 2
<hi>Theſ.</hi> 2. 10-12. And how contrary is this and ſuch like ſayings to our Saviours Doctrine here! So that I' hope this brief mention of one, will render that and its fellows ſufficiently abominable and loathſome to us.</p>
            <p n="7">7. And laſtly, Seeing few of the called are choſen, let it provoke us all ſo to obey the heavenly call by the Goſpel, that we may come out from among men, and be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate, and touch no unclean thing, that He may receive us, and may be a Father unto us, and we may be Sons and Daughters unto Him, who is the Lord Almighty, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 17, 18. <hi>Oh let us not receive the Grace of God in vain! But let us incline our Ears unto His call, ſo as to come unto Him, let us hear that our ſouls may live, and He may make an ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Covenant with us, even the ſure mercies of</hi> David, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55. 2, 3. And to move us hereto, let us conſider the laſt thing pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded to be ſhewn; namely,</p>
            <p n="3">3. That it is the great and inexcuſable ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity of thoſe Men who are called by the Goſpel, in the faithful miniſtration of it by the Servants, that they are not choſen:<pb facs="tcp:48995:93" rendition="simple:additions"/>And ſuch an one as is highly provoking to the great King. Thus it plainly appears here in the foregoing verſes: firſt it appears to be an inexcuſable iniquity, in that <hi>when the King came in to ſee the gueſts, and ſaw there a Man which had not on a wedding Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, He ſaith unto him, Friend, how cameſt thou in hither not having a Wedding Garment? And he was ſpeechleſs.</hi> He was ſo ſilent to, or ſilenc'd by this Queſtion, that he had not one word to ſay for himſelf. If there had been none for him, he might readily have made that reply; But this he could not do, for all things were ready. Or if he had not been acquainted with it, and called to it, this might have been a conſiderable excuſe: But ſuch a Plea he could not make; for he was called, and was one of the called ones into the houſe. Or if he could not have put it on, or it had been ſo far out of his reach that he could not come at it; this would have furniſhed him with an Anſwer near at hand. But he was convinced that his iniquity was altogether an inexcuſable iniquity;
<hi>And therefore he was like a dumb man that openeth not his mouth.</hi> Again, it plainly appeareth, that this iniquity is highly and eternally pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voking to the great King, by the judgment which ſuch as are not choſen are therefore<pb facs="tcp:48995:93" rendition="simple:additions"/>ſentenced unto, and ſhall in due time have executed upon them. <hi>Then ſaid the King unto the Servants, bind him hand and foot</hi> (who was tongue-tyed before) <hi>and caſt him into outer darkneſs, there ſhall be weeping and gnaſhing of the Teeth,</hi> ver.
11-13. But why muſt he be thus dealt with, and proceeded againſt? It followeth as the Reaſon: <hi>For many are called, but few are choſen:</hi> He muſt therefore periſh for ever, becauſe he would not come to Chriſt that he might be choſen: Him that cometh He will in no wiſe caſt out; but it appeareth this man came not to Chriſt to this end, in that he was caſt out: And therein his ſin was written on his puniſhment; he was thus ſeverely judged becauſe he was not choſen, compare <hi>Job.</hi> 6. 37. Matth. 22, 13.</p>
            <p>But as it appears here to be a great pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voking and inexcuſable iniquity that men are not choſen, ſo we ſhall a little further demonſtrate the truth hereof, and ſhew how it appears to be ſuch an heinous, cloak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, and provoking iniquity: And in ſo do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, I ſhall take the courſe which our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our and the Apoſtle ſometimes do, to wit, ſay over again what I have ſaid before, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14. 28. <hi>Gal.</hi>
1. 8, 9. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 1. And ſo,</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb facs="tcp:48995:94" rendition="simple:additions"/>1. It doth appear to be a great and inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſable iniquity that men are not choſen du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the day of Gods grace and patience, if we do conſider what is propoſed to, and ſet before men by Chriſts faithful Servants in their calling them, and to which they are called that they might be choſen: they are called unto Jeſus Chriſt, to the fellowſhip of Gods Son Jeſus Chriſt, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 9. And ſo</p>
            <p n="1">1. They are called unto the abaſement and ſufferings of Jeſus Chriſt, to the Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age of the Son of the great King, in which the Lord hath created a new thing in the Earth, a woman hath compaſſed a Man,
<hi>Jer.</hi> 31. 22. Gods own Son was made of a woman, and made under the Law: God made all our ſins and treſpaſſes to meet toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther on him, and executed upon him the judgment of the World. He was torment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for our Tranſgreſſions, bruiſed for our iniquities, the chaſtiſement of our peace was upon Him. It pleaſed the Lord to bruiſe Him, He put Him to Grief: He was oppreſſed and He was afflicted: And God brought Him into the duſt of death. And all that which He indured, as it was inflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on Him, or permitted and ordered unto Him by the Father, it was for our ſins and
<pb facs="tcp:48995:94" rendition="simple:additions"/>offences. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e ſuffered for ſins once, the juſt for us unjuſt ones; He was delivered for our offences; His Soul was made an offering for our ſins. And hereunto are men called firſt of all, to the end they might be choſen out of this preſent evil World, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 14. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 1-3.
<hi>Gal.</hi> 1. 4. &amp; 3. 1. and in this abaſement and Croſs of Chriſt is ſhewn unto Men.</p>
            <p>The vileneſs and odiouſneſs of their ſins, and the neceſſity of their being Waſhed and Sanctified therefrom, to the end they might lay apart all filthineſs and ſuperfluity of naughtineſs, as it is thus reproved and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered. In the Fleſh of Chriſt, and in what He hath ſuffered therein, God hath wonderfully condemned and judged againſt ſin, and ſhewed His utter and irreconcileable hatred thereto, and abhorrency thereof, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 3. <hi>This was the day of vengeance of our God, in which He took vengeance on our ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities in the Perſon of His own Son, who knew no ſin, but was Holy, Harmleſs, Undefiled,</hi> &amp;c.
<hi>Iſa.</hi> 61. 1, 2. And though His own Son cried out, <hi>My God, My God, why haſt Thou forſaken Me? Why art Thou ſo far from help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Me, and from the Words of My Roaring?</hi> Yet His God was ſo Holy, one of ſuch pure Eyes as that He could not endure Iniquity,<pb facs="tcp:48995:95" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <hi>and therefore He ſpared Him not, but delivered Him up for our Offences,</hi> Pſal. 22.
1-3. with Rom. 8. 32. &amp; 4. 25. Herein He hath mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted the exceeding ſinfulneſs of ſin, that it might be abhorred and abſtained from by us; in that it could not poſſibly <hi>be purged away by the blood of Bulls and Goats, nor by any Offerings and Sacrifices of the Law,</hi> Heb.
10. 1-4. But Chriſt muſt come into the World to ſuffer for them; and all His Sufferings would not avail, unleſs He dye for them: it was not one drop, nor twenty drops of His Blood would make peace for us, but Chriſt muſt needs Suffer, and lay down His Life for us, <hi>Acts</hi> 17. 3. It was otherwiſe impoſſible for our ſins to be ſatisfied for, and purged away, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26. 39, 42. For with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt, the Father, who ſo infinitely loved His own Son, would not without an abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute neceſſity have pleaſed thus to have dealt with Him. Herein brightly and moſt clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appears the odiouſneſs of our ſins unto God. And unto this Croſs of Chriſt are men called by the Goſpel that they might look unto Him who was Crucified for them, and be ſaved from their ſins, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 45. 22. with <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 1. And thoſe that do thus come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it, as called by the Goſpel, are made wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to hate and deny that which is ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſing<pb facs="tcp:48995:95" rendition="simple:additions"/>and abominable to God, and which is rendred ſo to be in the Blood of Chriſt, which is therefore alſo called, <hi>the Blood of Sprinkling,</hi> Heb. 9. 14. &amp; 10. 22. &amp; 12. 24. To this purpoſe the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>How ſhall we that are dead to ſin</hi> (by the death of Chriſt) <hi>live any longer therein? Know ye not that ſo many of us as were Baptized into Chriſt, were Baptized into His Death?</hi> into His per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal Abaſement, Sufferings and Death, whereto He was Abaſed, and which He ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered for our ſins, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 18. And how ſhall we then continue in ſin! God forbid; let not ſuch a thing be ever done by us: The beholding ſin in the Blood of Chriſt did fill them with an abhorrency and deteſtation of their ſins, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.
1-3. And by the preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous blood of Chriſt, the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth, <hi>the Believers to whom he wrote were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed from their vain converſation, in which ſometimes they walked, when they walked in Laſciviouſneſs, Luſts, Exceſs of Wine, Revel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, Banquettings, and abominable Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,</hi> 1 Pet. 1. 18, 19. with chapt. 4. 3. <hi>Hereby they were called out of Darkneſs,</hi> out of themſelves, who were ſometimes dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and out of their ſinful and polluted condition and ways, <hi>into Gods marvellous light, and ſo were made of the elect and choſen<pb n="180" facs="tcp:48995:96"/>generation,</hi> 1 Pet. 2. 9. with Eph. 5. 8.</p>
            <p>Yea and in the croſs of Chriſt, the vanity and emptineſs of our Idols is diſcovered to us, and therefore it alſo evidenceth the great iniquity of thoſe men who prefer vain things before the Lord of Glory.</p>
            <p>Herein is made known and ſhewn unto us the vanity and unprofitableneſs of the world, and the riches thereof, <hi>In that we were not redeemed with corruptible things as Silver and Gold, but with the precious Blood of Chriſt,</hi> 1 Pet. 1. 18, 19. <hi>They that truſt in their Wealth, and boaſt themſelves in the multitude of their riches: none of them can by any means redeem his B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

            <p>In the Croſs of Chriſt is alſo diſcovered to us, the bruitiſhneſs of our Wiſdom and Knowledge; In that this Wiſdom was not found in the land of the living, how we might be redeemed &amp; brought back to God, from whom we were baniſhed, <hi>Job</hi> 28. 12-21. 2

Iſa. 52. 14. &amp;
53. 2, 3. Bſal. 22. 6, 7.</p>
            <p>Herein is declared to us, <hi>That the friendſhip of this World is enmity with God: In that our Lord Jeſus was hated and villified by the World, diſallowed, rejected and refuſed by the men of it, as one that was judged altogether unworthy, and unmeet to be loved and delighted in by them,</hi> Joh. 7. 7. &amp; chap. 15. 18. &amp; 17. 14. 1 Pet. 2. 4.</p>

            <p>Now then, for Men to prefer their ſins and vanities before Chriſt: To prefer their ſinful luſts and pleaſures; or their Oxen, Farms, Merchandize, Wives, Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or any other of their own things before Him, in whom God hath prepared ſuch an excellent and incomparable feaſt; And in whom is ſuch a true, compleat, and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally bleſſed and glorious proviſion of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Life, and all Spiritual and Eternal Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings: And to do thus alſo after they have been called unto the Sufferings of Chriſt, in which is given ſuch a clear diſcovery of the odiouſneſs and abominableneſs of mens luſts and iniquities unto God; And therefore alſo of the abſolute neceſſity of their being waſhed and cleanſed from them, without which they muſt be everlaſtingly unhappy and miſerable: And in which Croſs is alſo clearly manifeſted the vanity and worthleſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of all thoſe objects and things in which

1. 25, 26. with <hi>Eph.</hi> 3. 3-5. God<pb n="188" facs="tcp:48995:100"/>having one Son, His well-beloved, He ſent Him forth laſt of all, and ſpake unto us by His Son, whom He hath appointed Heir of all things; and reſerved this Honour for His Son, that by Him in His Perſonal mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration, and by the miniſtration of His A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, the true light ſhould ſhine more brightly and clearly then it did in former Ages: <hi>He hath come a light into the World, who is the Sun of Righteouſneſs: And by Him the Goſpel hath been preached according to the Revelation of the myſtery,</hi> Rom. 16. 25,
26. ſo as now in the Goſpel of Chriſt, as now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed, Jeſus Chriſt is evidently ſet forth as one that hath been crucified for us: His Sufferings, the greatneſs and preciouſneſs of them, are brightly pourtrayed before us, therein, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 1. <hi>And we all with open face may behold in this glaſs</hi> (in this moſt clear medium) <hi>the glory of the Lord,</hi> 2 Cor. 3. 18. <hi>And now the Grace of God which bringeth Salvation to all men hath appeared, and been brightly manifeſted, as in former times it was not: It was witneſſed in former times in the Law, and by the Prophets: But in this was manifeſted the Love of God, becauſe God ſent His only begotten Son into the World, that we might live thorow Him,</hi> Tit. 2. 11. 1 Joh. 4. 9, 10. and anſwerably, ſin is now rendred
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:48995:100" rendition="simple:additions"/>more odious then it was in former times, eſpecially the ſin of the World upon a new account: <hi>The Holy Spirit,</hi> ſaith our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, <hi>ſhall convince the World of ſin: of ſin, becauſe they believe not on Me,</hi> Joh. 16. 8, 9.

23-25. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 17-20-29. Yea now there is a more plain declaration and diſcovery of the Subjects of Chriſts Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and of the love of God therein, then formerly was given forth, to wit, <hi>that it is a faithful ſaying, and worthy of all accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, That Chriſt Jeſus came into the World to ſave ſinners,</hi> ſinners indefinitely, without exception or excluſion of any, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 15. <hi>That Chriſt by the Grace of God taſted Death for every man: And gave Himſelf a Ranſome for all: And is the Saviour of the World.</hi> Heb. 2. 9. 1 Tim. 2. 6, 7, Joh.
4. 42. &amp; 12. 47. 1 Joh. 4. 14. And on this ground Chriſt by His Servants doth beſeech men, and perſwade them not to entertain or retain evil and hard thoughts of Him, but to come unto Him, as the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>He hath committed unto us the miniſtry of Reconciliation,</hi> to wit, <hi>That God was in Chriſt reconciling the World unto Him not
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:48995:101"/>imputing their Treſpaſſes to them.—Therefore we are Ambaſſadors for Chriſt, as though God did beſeech you by us, we pray you in Chriſts ſtead be ye reconciled to God,</hi> 2 Cor. 5. 14, 15,
18-20. &amp; 6. 1. Now then, by how much the more the greater light and clearer revelation is now vouchſafed to Men in the Goſpel as now preached, and by which Men are called unto Chriſt, by ſo much the more their iniquity is inexcuſable, and more highly diſpleaſing unto God. Hence our Saviour ſaith, <hi>It ſhall be more tolerable for Sodom and Gomorrah in the day of Judgment then it ſhould be for them that rejected Chriſt and His Goſpel,</hi> as it began to be Preached in the time of His Perſonal miniſtration, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10. 14, 15. &amp; 11. 20-24. Yea it will be more tolerable for Gods People in former times, who ſinned under that dark and dreadful miniſtration of the Law, as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſignifieth. Therefore (becauſe God hath ſpoken to us in theſe laſt days by His Son) we ought to give the more earneſt heed to the things we have heard, leſt at any time we ſhould let them ſlip: for if the word ſpoken by Angels was ſtedfaſt, and every tranſgreſſion and diſobedience received a juſt recompence of reward: How ſhall we eſcape if we neglect ſo great Salvation,<pb n="191" facs="tcp:48995:101"/>which at the firſt began to be ſpoken by the Lord, and was confirmed unto us by them that heard Him, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Heb. 1. 1-3. &amp; 2. 1-4. And again, <hi>He that deſpiſed Moſes Law died without mercy under two or three Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes:</hi> of how much ſorer puniſhment, ſuppoſe ye, ſhall he be counted worthy, who hath troden under foot the Son of God? <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Heb. 10. 28, 29. &amp;
12. 15-25-29. <hi>This is the condemnation, that Light is come into the World</hi> (as in former times it did not) <hi>and Men loved Darkneſs rather then Light,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 19. In the times of Mens ignorance God winked at them: but now <hi>(when thorow the tender mercy of our God the day ſpring from on high hath viſited us; to give Light to them that ſit in Darkneſs, and in the ſhadow of Death)</hi> He commandeth all Men every where to Repent: And they who will not ſo do, that they may believe and come to Chriſt that they may be choſen, will be more ſeverely proceeded againſt, and dealt with in the day of Wrath; and Revelation of the Righteous Judgment of God; <hi>who will render to every one according to their works,</hi> and according to the means vouchſafed: And ſo Wrath will be rendred to the <hi>Jew,</hi> and ſo we may ſay to the Chriſtian firſt; and alſo,<pb n="192" facs="tcp:48995:102"/>and after unto the <hi>Gentile, Acts</hi> 17.

            <p n="3">3. Their iniquity who are called by the Goſpel, as now preached, and not choſen, appears to be highly provoking, and alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether inexcuſable, if we further conſider the powerfulneſs of the call in and by which they are called, and by which they might be choſen alſo. Men are not only called with an outward call, as we have before ſaid; <hi>but loe He ſends forth His Voice therein, and that a mighty Voice: and ſpeaks by His Spirit to the Spirits of Men,</hi> 1 Pet. 3. 18, 19. with Gen. 6. 3. And by this Voice of His He doth awaken them, and cauſe them to hear, to the end they might come unto Chriſt, that they might be made of the Elect Generation. He now ſpeaks unto the dead Souls of Men, and His Voice is to the hearts of them, whoſe Voice all that are in the Graves ſhall hear, and ſhall come forth. It is the ſame Almighty Voice that is now ſent forth for converting the Soul, as will be to raiſe the dead out of their Graves hereafter, but not put forth in ſuch a manner, I mean, not irreſiſtibly: nay indeed as to the effecting the former it is called, <hi>the Voice of the Son of God;</hi> As to the effecting the latter, it is ſaid<pb n="193" facs="tcp:48995:102"/>to be, <hi>the Voice of the Son of Man,</hi> Joh. 5. 25, 27, 28. And indeed the powerfulneſs of the voice of Chriſt, in its preventing ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration in the Goſpel, appears to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded by our Saviour, to remove ſuch a jealouſie as might ariſe in Mens Hearts to their own, or others diſcouragement, as with reſpect to their utter importency and helpleſneſs in themſelves. Hence when our Saviour had directed to the way and means how Men might now have their ſtates al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, and be made of the choſen Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, who were not ſo formerly, in ſaying, <hi>Verily, Verily, I ſay unto you, He</hi> (who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever He be) <hi>that heareth My word, and believeth on Him that ſent Me, hath ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Life, and ſhall not come into condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, but is paſſed out of Death into Life:</hi> leſt any one ſhould diſcouragingly ſay; Alas, herein is ſignified to us, that Men are naturally dead, and deſtitute of all Spiritual Life, and how then ſhould they hear; To this our Saviour addeth; <hi>Verily, Verily, I ſay unto you the hour is coming, and now i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

<hi>ſhall live.</hi> In which ſaying, though He ſtill ſignifies, and gives us to underſtand, that Men are in and of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:48995:103"/>Dead, and ſo have no free-will or inclination to any thing that is ſpiritually good, yet He both intimates that the Voice of the Son of God accompanieth His Word; And alſo, that it doth ſo not only in His Perſonal, but alſo, and rather more power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, in His Spiritual Miniſtration to the end of the world, to enable dead ones to hear, <hi>that they might hear and live,</hi> Joh. 5. 24, 25. &amp; 7. 37-39. When perſons are aſleep, and dead in ſins and treſpaſſes, He then in and by His call in His Goſpel, by the Miniſtry of His Servants, awakens them, and rouzes them out of that ſad condition; Wherefore He ſaith, <hi>Awake thou that ſleepeſt, and ariſe from the Dead, and Chriſt ſhall give thee Light,</hi> Eph. 5. 13, 14. It is indeed certainly true, That all Men are naturally helpleſs in themſelves, and can neither will nor do any thing of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, as of themſelves that is ſpiritually good: But it is alſo as true, That the Grace of God doth bring Salvation to them in due time:
<hi>And Chriſt lighteth every Man that cometh into the World: He open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Eyes of the Blind</hi> in due time, and unſtoppeth their Ears in and by His Spirit in His Goſpel, <hi>and is turning Men from Darkneſs to Light, and from the Power of<pb n="195" facs="tcp:48995:103"/>Satan unto God;</hi> And then in the power and capacity given unto them by Him, they might hear and ſee and be conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: And it is Mens rebellious iniquity that it is not thus with them,

<hi>Ezek.</hi> 12. 2, 3. It is verily true, <hi>That no Man can come to Chriſt, except the Father who hath ſent Chriſt draw Him,</hi> Joh. 6. 44. But it is alſo as true, That God in and by Chriſt, in due time, doth draw them that come not; <hi>He draws all Men to Himſelf,</hi> Joh. 12. 31, 32. He draws them who refuſe to come with cords of a Man, and bands of Love: And becauſe He knows what a Yoke is upon them, without the removal whereof they would be hindred, therefore He takes off the Yoke on their Jaws,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> Hoſ. 11. 3, 4, 5. And ſince Chriſt hath finiſhed the work which the Father gave Him to do in His own per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal body on the Earth; ſince He laid down His Life, and is raiſed again; He hath now gloriouſly, and moſt immea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurably received the promiſe of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit in the Nature of Man: And hath more abundantly poured it forth on His Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants in their faithful declaring the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel then in former times: ſo that the
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:48995:104"/>Goſpel is called, <hi>the Miniſtration of Spirit and Life,</hi> yea, and <hi>the Spirit alſo,</hi> 2 Cor. 3. 6-8. Phil. 2.
16. So that it is only Mens own wilful and ſtubborn refuſal and rejection of the power of Chriſt in the call, which hinders their coming unto, and being choſen by Chriſt: they cloſe their Eyes (when opened) and ſtop their Ears, <hi>leſt they ſhould ſee with their Eyes, and hear with their Ears, and underſtand with their Heart, and ſhould be converted, and He ſhould heal them,</hi> Mat. 13. 15.

<hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 6-8. <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 16, 17. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 9. He therefore calls and ſtretcheth forth His hand, that they might come to the Feaſt He hath prepared for them. He doth not therefore call, that He might leave Men without excuſe; though they will be ſo, they will be Speechleſs who <pb facs="tcp:48995:104"/>are diſobedient to the Goſpel: nor is His end in calling them, to aggravate their condemnation; though their condemnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on will be aggravated, who when they are thus called unto the moſt High, will not at all Exalt Him, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 11. 2-4-7. But He therefore declares His Goſpel to them, and therewith councelleth them to come unto Himſelf, that they might liſten unto and obey Him, that it might go well with them for ever.

<pb n="199" facs="tcp:48995:105"/>of Chriſt, that they anſwer not His call who accompanieth them, and ſo are not choſen: This is that iniquity which is ſo greatly provoking unto the great King, that He thus threatneth to deal with ſuch as are guilty of it: <hi>Therefore will I num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber you to the Sword, and ye ſhall all bow down to the ſlaughter, becauſe when I called ye did not anſwer: when I ſpake ye did not hear, but did evil before Mine Eyes, and did chuſe that wherein I delighted not. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore behold My Servants</hi> (My choſen ones who did anſwer My call) <hi>ſhall eat, but ye ſhall be hungry: Behold My Servant<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> ſhall drink, but ye ſhall be thirſty: Behold My Servants ſhall rejoyce, but ye ſhall be aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med: Behold My Servants ſhall ſing for joy of heart, but ye ſhall cry for ſorrow of heart, and ye ſhall howl for vexation of ſpirit. And ye ſhall leave your name for a curſe unto My choſen,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 65. 12-15. with
<hi>Prov.</hi> 1. 24-32. &amp; <hi>Mat.</hi> 22. 13, 14.</p>
            <p>And it appears to be an inexcuſable ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, that thoſe who are ſo called are not choſen: <hi>There will be no Cloak for their ſin.</hi> They cannot plead that Chriſt never dyed for them, or that ſaving Grace was not afforded to them; for both theſe are falſe, as we have ſaid and ſhewn: But they will<pb n="200" facs="tcp:48995:106"/>be convinced in the day of the Revelation of the Righteous Judgment of God, that their Deſtruction and Non-election was wholly of themſelves: And therefore they will be found ſpeechleſs, as the Man was who had not on the Wedding Garment.</p>
            <p>Let the conſideration then of all ſaid, move and prevail with us all ſo to receive the Elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Grace of God, that we may be of the number according to the Election of Grace. And let us not liſten to ſuch deſperate ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings as theſe [If I be Elected no ſins can bereave me of Heaven; if I be Reproba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted no good deeds can help me to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.] But be we well aſſured, that the Scripture ſpeaketh of none as the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of Gods Election to Salvation, while they continue in their natural condition and filthineſs: nor of any Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probated before they were born, or Chriſt Preached by His Spirit to their Spirits: But all Men, while it is the day of Gods Grace and Patience towards them, may, thorow His Grace which bringeth Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to them, come to Chriſt, the prime Elect one, and root of Election, and ſo be reckoned after Him. God hath given His Son to be the ſign of His Gracious heart towards all ſinners; And to that
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:48995:106"/>End hath given Him by His Grace to taſt Death for every Man, and hath raiſed Him again from the Dead for their Juſtification; And hath given them Eternal Life, and this Life is in His Son: And ſent Him in the Goſpel to open their Eyes, and to bring forth the Priſoners out of the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and them that ſit in darkneſs out of the Priſon-houſe; that in obeying Him they might be called out of Darkneſs into His marvellous Light, and therein be of the choſen Generation, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 42.
1-7. with 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 9. Oh let none of us reject His Grace, nor receive it in vain: But let us, who are hearers of the word of truth, ſo look into the perfect law of Liberty, and continue therein, that we may not be forgetful hearers, but doers of the work, that we may be bleſſed in our deed, both now, and unto the day of Eternity. Oh! that we may not deceive our own Souls, in making a trade of hearing, and yet ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly prefer our Luſts and Idols before Him unto whom God hath given the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eminence in all things: If we ſhould thus do, what ſhall we ſay when God riſeth up? And when He ſhall judge the World in Righteouſneſs, what ſhall we anſwer Him? Others may ſay for themſelves,<pb n="202" facs="tcp:48995:107"/>(though unprofitably and wickedly) we knew thou art an hard and auſtere Maſter, Reaping where Thou haſt not Sown, and Gathering where Thou haſt not Strawn. They may ſay our Teachers perſwaded us that Chriſt died not for all, and we knew not whither He died for us: nor was there any true and ſaving Grace vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafed to us, if it had, we ſhould have done better. But thus, according to that judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment you profeſs to believe, you cannot plead. You have heard and been called by the Goſpel of Chriſt, the doctrine ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Godlineſs: And if you be not alſo choſen, you know it is only your own iniquity; And therefore you know there remaineth nothing but a certain fearful looking for of Judgment and fiery Indignation, which ſhall devour all them that obey not the Goſpel. Your Mouths have been already, and often ſtopt by the Goſpel, ſo as you cannot but confeſs that God is not willing with your Perdition; And if you Periſh, your Deſtruction will be altogether of your ſelves. Oh then! <hi>laying apart all Filthineſs and ſuperfluity of Naughtineſs, receive with Meekneſs the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graffed word, which is able to ſave your Souls.</hi> Oh that when it is too late, you<pb n="203" facs="tcp:48995:107"/>may not take up that complaint; <hi>How have we hated Inſtruction, and our heart deſpiſed Reproof! And we have not obeyed the voice of our Teachers, nor inclined our Ears to them that inſtructed us.</hi> If it ſhould be ſo with any of us, this will gnaw upon us to all Eternity, that when we were aſſured from Gods Teſtimony of Gods good will towards us, and that Chriſt wrought Redemption for us, and thorow the diſcovery thereof was powerfully Redeeming and Chooſing us from the Earth, and from amongſt Men, yet willingly and wilfully we, by obſerving lying vanities, did forſake our own mercy, <hi>Jonah</hi> 2. 8. That we for love to our ſins and vanities, the ſinfulneſs and vanity whereof we ſaw in the Croſs of Chriſt, and when infinitely better things were propoſed to us, ſhould yet in our hearts love Darkneſs, and the Devil, rather then Light and Chriſt. How can our heart endure the remembrance hereof! Or how can our hands be ſtrong when He ſhall plead with us! Oh conſider this ye that forget God, and ſpend your mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney for that which is not Bread! And ſo conſider the terrour of the Lord, as eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in the Croſs of Chriſt, that the time paſt of your life may ſuffice you to have wrought the will of the
<hi>Gentiles:</hi> And that now you<pb n="204" facs="tcp:48995:108"/>incline your ear, and come unto Him who calleth you by His Servants, that you may hear, that your Souls may live, and He may make an everlaſting covenant with you, even the ſure mercies of <hi>David.</hi> Oh! be not like to them, unto and concerning whom the Lord ſaith: <hi>ſtand ye in the ways and ſee, and ask for the old Paths, where is the good way, and walk therein, and ye ſhall find reſt for your Souls: but they ſaid we will not walk therein. Alſo I ſet Watchmen over you ſaying, hearken to the ſound of the Trumpet, but they ſaid we will not hearken.</hi> For be we well aſſured, if ſuch iniquity be found with us, and perſiſted in by us, that we will not come to Chriſt, who is the reſt; nor hearken unto, and obey the Trumpet of His Goſpel; if we will not be choſen, after all means uſed, and patience exerciſed, He will at laſt ſay of us as He did of them: <hi>The Bellows are burnt, the Lead is conſumed of the fire, the Founder melteth in vain, for the wicked are not plucked away. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate ſilver ſhall men call them, becauſe the Lord hath rejected them,</hi> Jer. 6. 16, 17-29, 30. Conſider what is ſaid, and the Lord give us underſtanding in all things.</p>
